## Complete the readings

Each class will have assigned readings. They will be posted on this website (under the topic for that day). I will assume you have done the readings and have at least a basic understanding of the material before coming to class. My general structure for the class is to spend the first part of class lecturing, then the remaining time practicing skills. If you do not come to class prepared, then there is no point in coming to class.


## Attend lectures 

I do not take attendance, but I expected that you come to class. Please, email me if you cannot make it to class (informing the instructor is as an act of courtesy and respect -- I won't ask questions or anything like that, unless it will become a regular issue). You will need to bring a computer to class each day to be able to follow along.


## Ask questions

Asking questions is an important part of this class. You can ask questions during class time, office hours, and on Ed Discussion. 

Rules/Expectations regarding office hours and Ed Discussion:

* *Office Hours rules:* this class is large, and there are a limited number of instructional staff members. To give the opportunity to everyone to attend office hours, please:
  * book max one week ahead: we will cancel all office hours booked in advance for the entire quarter
  * book a maximum of two office hours per week in total: if there are last-minute open slots from one of us, you are welcome to book more time; you can also ask if we can see you outside office hours, but please understand this is not guaranteed

* *Ed Discussion rules:* check out [this guide on how to properly ask questions](/faq/asking-questions/), including tips and details on what information you should include in your post. At the very minimum, we expect the following: 
  * before posting, search if someone else has posted the same or a similar question
  * provide an informative title: "I need help!" is not informative vs. "Getting a 'file not found error' when importing scotus.csv" is informative
  * use proper manners (Hello, thank you, etc.)
  * post your attempt at solving the problem: post your code properly formatted, describe what you have already attempted, and post pertinent error messages
  * if you solve the problem, let us know, and feel free to post your solution
  * allow 24 hours to receive an answer; please understand that questions posted the day the homework is due might not receive an answer on time, and questions posted during the weekend might not get answered until the following Monday
  
## Plagiarism and Academic integrity

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the [University of Chicago Code of Academic Integrity](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/academic-integrity-student-conduct). Under the provisions of the Code, anyone who gives or receives unauthorized assistance in the preparation of work at home or during tests in class will be subject to disciplinary action. A student's name on any piece of work is our assurance that they have neither given nor received any unauthorized help in its preparation. Students may assist each other on assignments by answering questions and explaining various concepts. However, one student should not allow another student to copy their work directly. All University policies with respect to cheating will be enforced.

Collaboration is good - researchers usually collaborate with one another on projects, developers work in teams to write programs. Why reinvent the wheel when it has already been done? This course strongly encourages collaboration with your peers but strongly discourages plagiarism. That is, you are expected to complete your own work. This means the following:
* If you work with someone else for a homework assignment, please mention it in your submission 
* Never blindly copy from your peers 
* Do not copy large chunks of code from the internet (but using the internet to debug programs is encouraged)
* Asking a classmate to help you debug your program is fine (the key phrase is *help you*, not do it for you)
The bottom line: if you don't understand what the program is doing and are not prepared to explain it in detail, you should not submit it.


## Statement on diversity, inclusion, and disability

The University of Chicago (as an institution) and I (as a human being and instructor of this course) am committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. The MAPSS, CIR, and Computation programs share this commitment and seek to foster productive learning environments based upon inclusion in education, open communication, and mutual respect for a diverse range of identities, experiences, and positions.

Services and reasonable accommodations are available to persons with temporary and permanent disabilities, to students with DACA or undocumented status, to students facing mental health or other personal challenges, and to students with other kinds of learning challenges. Please, feel free to let me know if there are circumstances affecting your ability to participate in class. 

If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Student Disability Services for a confidential discussion and for requesting accommodation: [SDS](https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/about-3-2-2/contact-us/). Once SDS approves your accommodation, it will be emailed to both you and me. Please, follow up with me to discuss the necessary logistics of your accommodations. If you need immediate accommodation, please speak with me after class or send an email message to me and [SDS](https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/about-3-2-2/contact-us/).

Any suggestions for how we might further such objectives both in and outside the classroom are appreciated and will be given serious consideration. Please share your suggestions or concerns with your instructors, your preceptor, or your programâ€™s Diversity and Inclusion representatives: Darcy Heuring (MAPSS), Matthias Staisch (CIR), and Chad Cyrenne (MACSS). You are also welcome and encouraged to contact the Faculty Director of your program.
