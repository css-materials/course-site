## Course objectives

The goal of this course is to acquire and practice **basic computational skills**. We focus on: learning R and learning practices for reproducible research. 

I start from the perspective that you want to analyze data, and *programming is a means to that end*. You will not become an expert programmer - that is a given. But you will learn the basic skills and techniques necessary to conduct computational social science, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your own research.

We will cover many different topics in this course, including:

* Elementary programming techniques (e.g., loops, conditional statements, functions)
* Writing reusable and clear code
* Problem-solving and debugging programs for errors
* Visualizing information
* Obtaining, importing, and munging data from a variety of sources
* Performing textual analysis
* Generating reproducible research

## How we will do this

This is a hands-on class. You will learn by writing programs and analysis. Don't fear the word "program". A program can be as simple as:


```r
print("Hello world")
```

```
## [1] "Hello world"
```

One line of code, and it performs a very specific task (print the phrase "Hello world" to the screen).

More typically, your programs will perform statistical and graphical analysis on data of a variety of forms. We will start small to build our way up to there.

Class sessions will include a combination of lecture and live-coding: **You need to bring a laptop to class to follow along**. All class materials (including slides and notes) will be made available before/after class for your review. The emphasis of the class is on application and learning how to implement different computational techniques. However, we will sometimes read examples of relevant scholarly research that demonstrates the capabilities and range of computational social science.

## Complete the readings

Each class will have assigned readings. **You need to complete these before coming to class.** I will assume you have done so and have at least a basic understanding of the material. My general structure for the class is to spend the first part of class lecturing, then the remaining time practicing skills. If you do not come to class prepared, then there is no point in coming to class.

## Ask questions

Asking questions is an important part of this class. You can ask questions during class time, office hours, and on Ed Discussion. 

Please, check out [this guide on how to properly ask questions, including tips and details on what information you should include in your post](/faq/asking-questions/).

## Plagiarism

I am trying to balance two competing perspectives:

1. Collaboration is good - researchers usually collaborate with one another on projects. Developers work in teams to write programs. Why reinvent the wheel when it has already been done?
1. Collaboration is cheating - this is academia. You are expected to complete your own work. If you copy from someone else, how do I know you actually learned the material?

The point is that collaboration in this class is good, **to a point**. You are always, unless otherwise noted, expected to write and submit your own work. You should not blindly copy from your peers. You should not copy large chunks of code from the internet. That said, using the internet to debug programs is fine. Asking a classmate to help you debug your program is fine (the key phrase is *help you*, not do it for you).

*The bottom line* - if you don't understand what the program is doing and are not prepared to explain it in detail, you should not submit it.

## Evaluations
