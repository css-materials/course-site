## Required textbook

The main textbook for this course is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. There is also a 2nd edition of this book (released in Summer 2023). We will be using both (online and free).

  > Completing the exercises in the book? No official solution manual exists, but several can be found online (for the 1st edition of the book). I recommend [this version by Jeffrey B. Arnold](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/). Your exact solutions may vary, but these can be a good starting point.

Please notice that each class will have assigned readings from this book or from other resources: they will all be posted on this website. You need to complete the assigned readings before coming to class. 


## Additional resources

* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 3rd Edition](https://ggplot2-book.org/) -- Hadley Wickham. Excellent resource for the [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) graphics library.
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) -- Hadley Wickham. A deep dive into R as a programming language, not just a tool for data science.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/) -- Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. A thorough introduction to statistical learning and machine learning methods, focusing on the fundamentals of how these methods work and the assumptions that go into them. See also [ISLR `tidymodels` Labs](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/). This site demonstrates how to implement all the labs.
* [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - printable cheat sheets for common R tasks and features.
    
## Resources for under-represented groups in programming

Thanks to [Angela Li](https://angela-li.github.io/) for compiling these recommendations:

* [R LGBTQ Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_lgbtq): Affinity group for queer people in the R community -- Twitter often promotes events, panels and talks by and for queer R users. 
* [Gayta Science Twitter](https://twitter.com/gaytascience): Alliance that uses data science techniques to give LGBTQ+ experiences a voice -- Twitter will often share data-driven work concerning the LGBTQ+ community. 
* [RLadies Community Slack](http://bit.ly/rladies-slack): A global programming meetup for non-binary, trans, and female R users. 
* [RLadies Remote Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesRemote): Remote chapter of R Ladies -- has Slack coffee chats to discuss programming topics in a supportive environment. 
* [People of Color Code Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/People-of-Color-Code/): A meetup for POC software developers -- has events where POC developers can work on personal projects, collaborate, and learn. 
* [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io/): A task force set up by the R Foundation to address the under-representation of under-represented groups in the R community -- collects representation data in the R community, produces workshops and teaching materials
