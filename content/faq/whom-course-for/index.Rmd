## General description

This course is open to any graduate and advanced undergraduate at the University of Chicago. I anticipate drawing students from a wide range of departments such as Information Science, Sociology, Psychology, Political Science, etc. Typically these students are looking to learn basic computational and analytic skills they can apply to master's projects or dissertation research.

I start from the perspective that you want to analyze data, and *programming is a means to that end*. You will not become an expert programmer, but you will learn the basic skills and techniques necessary to conduct computational social science, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your own research.

We will cover many different topics in this course, including:

* Elementary programming techniques (e.g., loops, conditional statements, functions)
* Writing reusable and clear code
* Problem-solving and debugging programs for errors
* Visualizing information
* Obtaining, importing, and munging data from a variety of sources
* Performing textual analysis
* Generating reproducible research

If you have never programmed before **prepare for a shock**. This class will prove to be very beneficial if you stick with it, but that will require you to commit for the full quarter. I guarantee that the first few weeks and assignments will be rough - but the good news is that they will be rough for everyone! Your classmates are struggling with you and you can lean on one another to get through the worst part of the learning curve.

## What do I need for this course?

**You will need to bring a computer to class each day.** Class sessions are a mix of lecture, demonstration, and coding. It is essential to have a computer so you can follow along and complete the exercises. All class materials (including slides and notes) will be made available before/after class for your review.

<!--
By the end of the first week, you should make sure you can access the following software:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - the easiest approach is to select a [pre-compiled binary appropriate for your operating system](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
* [RStudio's IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) - this is a powerful user interface for programming in R.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which is used to manage projects and track changes in computer files. Once installed, it can be integrated into RStudio to manage your course assignments and other projects.

Comprehensive instructions for downloading and setting up this software can be found [here](/setup/).
