This section contains the homework assignments for the course. They will be released as the quarter progresses, and you will have one week to complete each assignment. 

There will be a total of seven homework assignments, plus one opportunity to re-do a past assignment to change your grade. The seventh assignment will act as a final project for the course and cannot be re-done.

- **HW04: Programming in R.** Practice programming techniques in R
- **HW05: Debugging and practice working with functions.** Resolve code errors and practice writing and using functions with social science data
- **HW06: Collecting and analyzing data from the web.** Collect data from the web and analyze it
