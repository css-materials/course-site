This section will contain the homework assignments for the course. Homework will be released weekly, as the quarter progresses. 

There will be a total of seven homework assignments + one opportunity to re-do a past homework to change your grade. The seventh homework assignment will act as a final project for the course and cannot be re-done. You will have one week to complete each homework. 

The homework assignments are as follows:

- **HW01: Practice editing .md and .Rmd.** Goal: Test software installation and homework submission process, as well as demonstrate basic competency in Markdown and R Markdown. 
- **HW02: Exploring and visualizing data.** Goal: Transform and explore a cleaned dataset on gun deaths in the United States.
- **HW03: Wrangling and visualizing data.** Goal: Wrangle and explore messy datasets in practical research environments.
- **HW04: Programming in R.** Goal: Practice programming techniques in R.
- **HW05: Debugging and practice working with functions.** Goal: Resolve code errors and practice writing and using functions with social science data.
- **HW06: Collecting and analyzing data from the web.** Goal: Collect data from the web and analyze it.
- **HW07: Generating reproducible social science research.** Goal: Synthesize everything we have learned thus far through your own research project.

HW01 is worth 5% of your final grade, HW02 to HW06 are worth each 15% of your final grade, and HW07 is worth 20% of your final grade.
