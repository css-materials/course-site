# Overview

**Due by 11:59 pm on Friday, October 7th.**

The goal is to test your software installation, your GitHub setup, and the homework submission process, as well as demonstrate basic competency in Markdown and R Markdown.

# Accessing the `hw01` repository

Accept the repo and clone it:
* Go [at this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/GJXNztug) to accept and create your private `hw01` repository on GitHub. Once you do so, your repository will be built in a few seconds. It follows the naming convention `hw01-<USERNAME>`  
* Once the your repository has been created, click on its link, which will take you to your repository. 
* Finally, clone the repository to your computer (or R workbench) using the process below. 

Whenever possible, this will be the preferred route for setting up your R projects:

* In RStudio or RStudio Workbench, start a new Project with *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*. In the "repository URL" paste the URL of your newly created GitHub repository (remember to grab the correct link, either SSH or HTTP). Do not modify the repository name. 
* Decide where to store the local directory for the project. Don't scatter everything around your computer - have a central location, or some meaningful structure. For example, for repositories you create in this course, you can setup a `css` directory and clone all your repos there.
* Before proceeding, check the little box "Open in new session", as that's what you'll usually do in real life.
* Click "Create Project" to create a new sub-directory, which will be all of these things:
    * a directory on your computer
    * a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository
    * an RStudio Project

Before completing the above steps, ensure you followed the configuration steps [here](/setup/git-configure/), and everything works as expected.

# General workflow
Your general workflow will be:

<!--
* Pull from GitHub (just an empty precaution now, but it will matter when you collaborate with others)
-->
* Accept the repo and clone it (see above)
* Make changes locally to the files (here `README.md` and `Rcode.rmd`) in RStudio
* Save your changes
* Stage-Commit-Push: stage and commit your changes to your repo; then push them online to GitHub (You can complete these steps using the Git GUI integrated into RStudio).


# What you need to submit

Written assignments for this course will be submitted using Markdown and R Markdown: [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (.md) is a lightweight text formatting language that easily converts between file formats. Regular Markdown files (.md) are rendered on the GitHub website and can be directly read on the website. They are also integrated directly into [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (.rmd or .Rmd), which combines R code, output, and written text into a single document. GitHub includes [a guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for writing Markdown documents.

For this assignment, you need to modify and push to your GitHub homework repository the following two files: `README.md` and `Rcode.rmd`


## `README.md` 

When you create the repository, you will notice there is already a `README.md` file in the repo. A README is usually a plain txt or md file. The purpose of a README file in a repository is to communicate important information about your project (software, how to run the code, preview of the results, etc.). The goal of this assignment is to practice generating and editing README.

Your task is to edit this file by adding a brief biography of yourself. To achieve full marks, your README should include the following elements:

* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and your experience with Markdown 


## `Rcode.rmd`

When you create the repository, you will notice there is already a `Rcode.rmd` file in the repo. Your task is to edit this file by adding more YAML arguments (see readings) and at least two R code chunks (use the in-class materials on intro to R as starting point). To achieve full marks, your `Rcode.rmd` should include the following elements:

* At least one new YAML Header argument
* At least two R code chunks. Notice they must execute correctly and your final knitted document (which you should submit as well) must display both the code and the results
* A brief text that explains what each code chunk does


# Submit the assignment

To submit the assignment, simply push to your repository the last version of your assignment before the deadline.

# Rubric

Needs improvement: `README.md` says the equivalent of "This is the repository of Jonny Smith" with little details. `Rcode.rmd` contains R code chunks, but no explanation nor additional YAML headers are added. All work done via Git/Github ... but that's just a guess, because the student doesn't explain how it was done. 

Satisfactory: Something in between

Excellent: `README.md` provides a proper introduction of the student. It also demonstrates experimentation with several aspects of the Markdown syntax (e.g., section headers, links, bold, italic, bullet points, image, etc.). The student describes how they got the changes into `README.md` and offers a few reflections on their Git/GitHub workflow and their experience with Markdown. `Rcode.rmd` knits properly and contains YAML headers, R code chunks, with a detailed explanation of them.
