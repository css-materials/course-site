# Overview

**Due Thursday, November 2nd (11:59 PM).**

The goal of this assignment is to practice basic R programming skills, especially control structures and functions.


# Accessing the `hw04` repository

* Go [at this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/ZDvtwIwG) to accept and create your private `hw03` repository on GitHub. Once you do so, your repository will be built in a few seconds. It follows the naming convention `hw04-<USERNAME>`  
* Once the your repository has been created, click on the link you see, which will take you to your repository. 
* Finally, clone the repository to your R Workbench (or your computer if you have installed R there) following the process below.


# Cloning your `hw04` repository

After you have accessed the `hw04` repository (see above), follow the [same steps you completed for `hw01`](/homework/edit-readme/) to clone the repository.


# General workflow

See Homework 1


# Assignment description

This assignment requires you to complete the following six programming tasks.


#### Question 1. 
Compute the number of unique values in each column of the `iris` dataset. Write code that solves this task using: a `for` loop, `map()`, and `across()`.


#### Question 2. 
Calculate the square of each element in the given vector `v` using a `for` loop and `map()`.

```{r}
v <- seq(from = 20, to = 1)
v
```


#### Question 3. 
Calculate the square of all elements in the given matrix `m` using `for` loops and `apply()`. Check the documentation for `apply()`.

```{r}
m <- matrix(c(1:16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
m
```


#### Question 4.
Write a function that takes two numbers and calculates the sum of the squared value of them. Call the function with a couple of examples.


#### Question 5.
Write code to calculate the length of sides in a right-triangle using the [Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):  
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
Your tasks:

- set up your triangle sides, call them a, b, c, and give them values 3, 4, NULL
- check how many sides you have provided values for, and for each evaluation print a message; if you provided the lengths of only one side or all three sides, the printed message should warn you to provide value for two sides only
- perform the calculations applying the Pythagorean Theorem


#### Question 6.
Rewrite your code from the previous question as a function (e.g., write a function to calculate the length of sides in a right-triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem) and add some additional checks. Call the function with some examples.

Your tasks:

- set up your triangle sides as function parameters
- the function should be flexible: the function works if the user gives it values for two sides, but they can be either `a` and `b`, or `b` and `c`, or `a` and `c`
- if the user only provides the length of one side, the function should throw an error with stop(), [see here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html)
- if the user provides the lengths of all three sides, the function should throw an error with stop()
- if the user provides any values other than numeric values, the function should throw an error with stop()
- perform the calculations applying the Pythagorean Theorem
- call the function with a few examples, include also examples in which the function should throw an error
    
Your function should be able to correctly handle the examples below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "80%" }
knitr::include_graphics("correct.png")
```

# Submit the assignment

To submit the assignment, follow these steps:

* First push to your repository the last version of your assignment before the deadline. Make sure to stage-commit-push the following files:

  - `programming_exercises.Rmd`: the main file you will add your code to
  - `programming_exercises.md`:you will generate this file from the .Rmd by simply knitting it 

* When you are ready to submit, copy your repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/css-fall23/hw4-brinasab) and submit it on Canvas under HW04 before the deadline. Do not submit files on Canvas, we only need the link to your repository 

* As part of your submission, in the Rmd for this homework:
  * write 1-2 paragraphs of reflections about the homework
  * list the first and last name of eventual collaborators with whom you worked with to complete this assignment
  

# Assessment

All homework assignments are evaluated using [this general rubric](/faq/homework-evaluations/). Make sure to check it. 

Below are further guidelines for this specific homework to help you assess your work before submitting it.

*Needs improvement:* Doesn't complete all components. Code contain errors and/or is not clearly written and/or not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No record of commits other than the final push to GitHub.

*Good:* Solid effort. Hits all the elements. Finished all components of the assignment with only minor deficiencies. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). Shows sufficient command of basic R programming skills.

*Excellent:* Finished all components of the assignment correctly and used efficient code to complete the exercises. Provide multiple options to answer the same question. Show solid command of basic R programming skills. Functions are written succinctly and comprehensibly. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Use multiple commits to back up and show a progression in the work.
