The Department of Education collects [annual statistics on colleges and universities in the United States](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/). A subset of this data from 2018-19 is included in the [`rcis`](https://github.com/css-materials/rcis) library from GitHub. 

{{% callout note %}}
If you are working on your local R you need to install the package first by running the command `remotes::install_github("css-materials/rcis")` in the console. If you don't already have the `remotes` library installed, you will get an error. Go back and install this first using `install.packages("remotes")`, then run `remotes::install_github("css-materials/rcis")`.

```{r scorecard}
library(rcis)
data("scorecard")
glimpse(scorecard)
```


`glimpse()` is part of the `tibble` package and is a transposed version of `print()`: columns run down the page, and data runs across. With a data frame with multiple columns, sometimes there is not enough horizontal space on the screen to print each column. By transposing the data frame, we can see all the columns and the values recorded for the initial rows.

Type `?scorecard` in the console to open up the help file for this data set. This includes the documentation for all the variables. Use your knowledge of `dplyr` and `ggplot2` functions to answer the following questions.


## Which type of college has the highest average SAT score?

**NOTE: This time, use a graph to visualize your answer, [not a table](/notes/transform-college/#generate-a-data-frame-with-the-average-sat-score-for-each-type-of-college).**

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

We could use a **boxplot** to visualize the distribution of SAT scores.

```{r sat-boxplot}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type, y = satavg)
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

According to this graph, private, nonprofit schools have the highest average SAT score, followed by public and then private, for-profit schools. But this doesn't reveal the entire picture. 

What happens if we plot a **histogram** or **frequency polygon**? A frequency polygon is similar to a histogram but makes it easier to see the shape of the distribution. 

```{r sat-histo-freq}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = satavg)
) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(type))

ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = satavg, color = type)
) +
  geom_freqpoly()
```

From these graphs, we can see the averages for each college type are based on widely varying sample sizes.

Based on these results, we can further inquiry our data to check the observations that have valid SAT averages scores, thus filtering all the "NA":

```{r sat-bar}
# observations with non-NA SAT averages
scorecard %>%
  drop_na(satavg) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type)
  ) +
  geom_bar()

# what proportion of observations have NA for satavg?
scorecard %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize(prop = sum(is.na(satavg)) / n()) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type, y = prop)
  ) +
  geom_col()
```

There are far fewer private, for-profit colleges than the other categories. Furthermore, private, for-profit colleges disproportionately fail to report average SAT scores compared to the other categories (likely these schools do not require SAT scores from applicants). 

A boxplot alone would not reveal this detail, which could be important in future analysis.

## What is the relationship between net cost of attendance and faculty salaries? How does this relationship differ across types of colleges?

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r cost-avgfacsal}
# geom_point
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = netcost, y = avgfacsal)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_point with alpha transparency to reveal dense clusters
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = netcost, y = avgfacsal)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_hex
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = netcost, y = avgfacsal)
) +
  geom_hex() +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_point with smoothing lines for each type
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = netcost,
    y = avgfacsal,
    color = type
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_point with facets for each type
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = netcost,
    y = avgfacsal,
    color = type
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(type))
```

## How are a college's Pell Grant recipients related to the average student's education debt?

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

Since both Pell Grant recipient `pctpell` and average student's dept `debt` are continuous variables a **scatterplot** is appropriate:

```{r pell-scatter}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Hmm. There seem to be a lot of data points. It isn't really clear if there is a trend. What if we make our data points semi-transparent using the `alpha` aesthetic?

```{r pell-alpha}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2)
```

Now we're getting somewhere. I'm beginning to see some dense clusters in the middle. Maybe a **hexagon binning** plot would help

```{r pell-bin}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_hex()
```

This is getting better. It looks like there might be a downward trend; that is, as the percentage of Pell grant recipients increases, average student debt decreases. Let's confirm this by going back to the scatterplot and overlaying a **smoothing line**.

```{r pell-smooth}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth()
```

This confirms our initial evidence - there is an apparent negative relationship. 

Take-home point: Notice how we iterated through several different plots before we created one that provided the most informative visualization. **You will not create the perfect graph on your first attempt.** Trial and error is necessary in this exploratory stage. Be prepared to revise your code again and again.
