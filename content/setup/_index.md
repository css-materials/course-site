Please, follow one of these two options to get all the necessary software. I encourage all students (and especially beginners) to utilize Option 1. 

{{% callout note %}}

I encourage all students to utilize Option 1: RStudio Workbench. This will ensure we all use a consistent software environment. If you choose to install your own software locally (Option 2), I cannot guarantee the instructional staff will be able to help you troubleshoot issues caused by software configuration.
