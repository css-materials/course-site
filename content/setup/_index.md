Please, follow one of the two options to get all the necessary software and get it setup and working. I encourage all students (and especially novices) to utilize Option 1. 

complete the required steps for both options (at the end).

{{% callout note %}}

I encourage all students to utilize Option 1: RStudio Workbench. This will ensure we all use a consistent software environment. If you choose to install your own software locally (Option 2), I cannot guarantee the instructional staff will be able to help you troubleshoot issues caused by software configuration.

## Option 1 - access RStudio Workbench

This option does not require installing anything on your computer, because allows accessing R and RStudio through your web browser. All you have to do is the following:
* [Register a free GitHub account.](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct). Once you create a GitHub account, you are stuck with that username: choose something professional. 
* [Access RStudio Workbench](/setup/r-server/)
* [Configure Git](/setup/git-configure/)
* Test that everything works by following the instructions provided under [Using Git within RStudio](/setup/git-with-rstudio/)

## Option 2 - install R and RStudio locally

If you want to run R and R studio on your own computer, follow these instructions in the provided order:
* [Register a free GitHub account.](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct). Once you create a GitHub account, you are stuck with that username: choose something professional. 
* [Install and setup R](/setup/r/)
* [install Git](/setup/git/)
* Optional: [install a Git client](/setup/git-clients/) or use Git via command line or RStudio (this is the most common choice, you do not have to install anything but make sure to configure Git so RStudio finds it)
* [configure Git](/setup/git-configure/)
* Test that everything works by following the instructions provided under [Using Git within RStudio](/setup/git-with-rstudio/)
