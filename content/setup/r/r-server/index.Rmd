This page provides a few definitions (R, RStudio, RStudio Workbench) and provides instructions to access RStudio Workbench (Option 1).

## R and R Studio

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source programming (you can find more info [here]). When people mention R, they might refer to the base R distribution or to its most popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment): R Studio. Most people do not use R in its bare distribution but through a IDE, which makes it easier to interact with R and write code. There are different IDEs that can be used with R, but the most popular is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) and in this course we will use it. RStudio is open-source, expandable, and provides many useful tools and enhancements over the base R environment.

## RStudio Workbench

Rather than installing your own copy of R and RStudio, you can access R and RStudio remotely hosted on a server. Specifically, the [Social Sciences Computing Services](https://sscs.uchicago.edu/) hosts RStudio Workbench for us. Rather than running an application on your computer, you open RStudio in your web browser. All the processing and computation is done on a remote server. This means virtually all of the software is pre-configured for you. Setup is minimal.

The downside is that you only have access to this server for the duration of the class. If you intend to use R and RStudio in future classes/research projects, you will need to install and configure everything on your own computer after the course is completed.

## Accessing RStudio Workbench

1. Go to https://macss-r.uchicago.edu/ to login to the server. Save the link somewhere since you will be using it frequently
2. Use your [CNetID](https://uchicago.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&kb=KB06000393) and password to login (this is the same username/password you use for other UChicago online services).
3. You're done. You should see a fresh RStudio window in your browser.

Only students in this course who have been approved by SSCS can access this server. If you cannot log on to the server, email me at nardin@uchicago.edu or the Server Team at ssc-server-support@lists.uchicago.edu to let them know that you are enrolled in the class (MACS 30500) and you have problems accessing the server.

If you have problems with cVPN or the network, contact [ITS](https://its.uchicago.edu/)

## Testing RStudio Workbench

You should see something that looks like this:

{{< figure src="rstudio-server.png" caption="" >}}

The RStudio IDE is divided into 4 separate panes (one of which is hidden for now) which all serve specific functions. To make sure R and RStudio are setup correctly, type `x <- 5 + 2` into the *console* pane (the one on the left side of your screen) and execute it by pressing Enter/Return. You just created an object in R called `x`. Type `print(x)` into the console and press enter again. Your console should now contain the following output:

```{r testrstudio}
x <- 5 + 2
print(x)
```
