## Overview

* Identify multiple methods for obtaining data from the internet
* Define web-scraping
* Define Application Program Interface (API)
* Explain APIs authentication keys and demonstrate secure methods for storing these keys
* Interact with APIs
* Define JSON data structure and how to convert them to data frames

<!--
* Practice tidying messy JSON data objects using `tidyr`
* Demonstrate how to use canned packages in R to access APIs
* Practice gathering data from Twitter API using the `rtweet` package in R
-->

## Before class

* Chapter 1 and 4 in [Web Scraping with R](https://steviep42.github.io/webscraping/book/)

Several packages are needed for this week's lectures (all installed on R workbench). If you are using R from your laptop (VS. R Workbench), I'd suggest following the lectures using R Workbench and installing the packages after class.
