## Overview

* Introduce supervised and unsupervised text classification
* Define sentiment analysis and demonstrate its use (Chapter 2)
* Define topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet allocation and demonstrate its use (Chapter 6)


## Before class

* Read Chapter 2 and Chapter 6 in [Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/)
* Read [Probabilistic Topic Models](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf) by Blei, David (2012)

<!--
*[Topic modeling](/notes/topic-modeling/) from the lecture notes demonstrates how to implement this in a (semi)-tidy workflow

## Additional resources

* See additional resources for the previous lecture on text analysis and regular expressions
* Original [Topic Modeling (LDA) article](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com) by Blei, David M., Andrew Y. Ng, and Michael I. Jordan. 2003. “Latent Dirichlet Allocation.”
* For an introduction to supervised classification with text data, read [Classification](https://smltar.com/mlclassification.html) in Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R
* Two blog posts by David Robinson (co-author of `tidytext`) analyzing Donald J. Trump's twitter account. Regardless of your political affiliations, these are excellent examples demonstrating of the key principles of reproducible research that we've learned in this course (e.g., R Markdown documents and knitting code with output; Retrieving data from APIs; Textual analysis with `tidytext`; Visualizations with `ggplot2)
