## Overview

* Define control structures
* Introduce conditional statements
* Introduce iterative operations: with loops and with R-specific functions (e.g., `map()` functions, and `dplyr::across()`)


## Before class

* Read [Chapter 13 “Control Structures”](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/control-structures.html) in "R programming for Data Science" (this is not our regular book!)
* Read ["Chapter 26 Iteration"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition.


## Class materials

TBA. In-class materials (code, exercises, etc.) will be posted right before class.
