## Overview

* Think at programming as a form of problem solving
* Identify the most common dplyr "verbs" for data manipulation
* Familiarize with "pipes"
* Operators


## Before class

* Read ["Chapter 3 Data transformation"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. To be able to follow today's lecture, you need to read this chapter. 
* This applies only if you have installed R/RStudio locally: 
    * Install the [`rcis`](https://github.com/css-materials/rcis) library from GitHub. To do so, run the command `remotes::install_github("css-materials/rcis")` in your console. We will be using data from this package in class.
    * If you do not already have the `remotes` library installed, you will get an error. Install it first using `install.packages("remotes")`, then run `remotes::install_github("css-materials/rcis")`.
    

## Class materials

TBA. In-class materials (code, exercises, etc.) will be posted right before class.

    * To find which peers you will evaluate:
        * Navigate to the [course organization page on GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cis-fa22)
        * Find the `hw01` repos you can see that are not your own repo
        * Open the repos and find the pull request. You can then initiate a [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review) to leave detailed feedback.
