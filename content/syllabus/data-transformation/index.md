## Overview

* Identify  programming as a form of problem solving
* Practice decomposing a goal into a set of discrete, computational tasks
* Identify the basic verbs for a language of data manipulation
* Familiarize with Pipes
* Practice transforming data


## Before class

* Required: read Chapter 5 "Data Transformation" and Chapter 18 "Pipes" from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* This applies only if you have installed your software locally: 
    * Install the [`rcis`](https://github.com/css-materials/rcis) library from GitHub. To do so, run the command `remotes::install_github("css-materials/rcis")` in your console. We will be using data from this package in class.
    * Notice: if you do not already have the `remotes` library installed, you will get an error. Install it first using `install.packages("remotes")`, then run `remotes::install_github("css-materials/rcis")` in your console.

* Complete your peer evaluations for homework 01. Review the following:
    * [General Homework Rubric](/faq/homework-evaluations/)
    * [Performing peer review](/faq/peer-evaluations/)
    * To find which peers you will evaluate:
        * Navigate to the [course organization page on GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cis-fa22)
        * Find the `hw01` repos you can see that are not your own repo
        * Open the repos and find the pull request. You can then initiate a [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review) to leave detailed feedback.
