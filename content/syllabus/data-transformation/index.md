## Overview

* Identify  programming as a form of problem solving
* Practice decomposing a goal into a set of discrete, computational tasks
* Identify the basic verbs for a language of data manipulation
* Familiarize with Pipes
* Practice transforming data


## Before class

* Required: read Chapter 5 "Data Transformation" and Chapter 18 "Pipes" from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)


## Class materials

* [Computer programming as a form of problem solving](/notes/problem-solving/)
* [`dplyr` in brief](/notes/dplyr/)
* [Practice transforming college education data](/notes/transform-college/)

## Additional resources

* Cheat sheet [Data Wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr`](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)


## What you need to do after class

* Submit Homework 1
* Start Homework 2
* Review this week's readings and notes

<!--
* Complete your peer evaluations for homework 01. Review the following:
    * [General Homework Rubric](/faq/homework-evaluations/)
    * [Performing peer review](/faq/peer-evaluations/)
    * To find which peers you will evaluate:
        * Navigate to the [course organization page on GitHub](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cis-fa22)
        * Find the `hw01` repos you can see that are not your own repo
        * Open the repos and find the pull request. You can then initiate a [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review) to leave detailed feedback.
