## Overview

* Define a bug
* Review best practices for reading, writing, and styling code
* Distinguish between errors, warnings, and messages
* Identify and practice methods for error handling and recovery

<!--
* Interpret function documentation
* Introduce `traceback()` and explain how to read it
-->

## Before class

* Read "Debugging R code" in [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://rstats.wtf/debugging-r-code.html)
* Skim [The `tidyverse` style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/)
* Read [How to read an R help page](http://socviz.co/appendix.html#how-to-read-an-r-help-page)
* Review [21.6 Dealing with failure in *R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#dealing-with-failure)

## Class materials

* No in-class materials (today we complete in-class materials for "Data Structures" lecture)
* Review the assigned readings for further insights and practice 

<!--
* [Bugs and styling code](/notes/style-guide/)
* [Debugging and condition handling](/notes/condition-handling/)
* [*Naming things*](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf) - by Jenny Bryan. A concise guide to naming files.
