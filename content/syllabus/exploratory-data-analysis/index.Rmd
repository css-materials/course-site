## Overview

* Define Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and types of pattern exploration
* Demonstrate types of graphs useful for EDA and how to interpret them
* Define factors
* Practice EDA


## Before class

Tasks:

* Make sure you have accepted and cloned the repo for [Homework 2](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/homework/explore-data/)

Readings:

* ["Chapter 10 Exploratory Data Analysis"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition
* ["Chapter 16 Factors"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. Only skim this chapter for now, we will come back to Factors later in the course  


## Class materials

* Run the code below in your console to download todayâ€™s materials: `usethis::use_course("css-materials/exploratory-data-analysis")`

## Additional resources

* Antony Unwin [Graphical Data Analysis with R](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/11609643#). It covers a range of graphical methods for data exploration and analysis; draws on packages beyond `ggplot2` for statistical graphics.
