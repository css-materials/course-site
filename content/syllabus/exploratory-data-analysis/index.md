## Overview

* Define Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and types of pattern exploration
* Demonstrate types of graphs useful for EDA and precautions when interpreting them
* Define factors
* Practice exploring data


## Before class

* Read Chapter 7 “Exploratory Data Analysis” and Chapter 15 "Factors" from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Additional resources

* Antony Unwin [Graphical Data Analysis with R](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/11609643#). It covers a range of graphical methods for data exploration and analysis; draws on packages beyond `ggplot2` for statistical graphics.
