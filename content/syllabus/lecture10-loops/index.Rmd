<!-- NOTES FALL 2024
ADD TO IN-CLASS MATERIALS THE DEMO LOOP, NEEDS REVISIONS CURRENTLY ON DESKTOP
-->

## Overview

* Introduce iterative operations with loops
* Introduce R-specific functions for looping (e.g., `map()` functions, and `dplyr::across()`)


## Readings

* Review [Chapter 13 “Control Structures”](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/control-structures.html) in "R programming for Data Science" from last lecture (Notice this is not our regular book!)
* Read ["Chapter 26 Iteration"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition.
* R-specific functions for looping:
  * ["`purrr` package"](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) for `map()` functions 
  *[`across()` from `dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html)


## Class materials

In-class materials (exercises and code) will be posted here shortly before class.
