## Overview

* Difference between web-scraping and Application Program Interface (API)
* Define HTML and CSS selectors
* Introduce the `rvest` package
* Demonstrate how to extract information from HTML pages
* Practice scraping data


## Before class

* Chapter 1 and 4 in [Web Scraping with R](https://steviep42.github.io/webscraping/book/)
* Short optional articles that summarize the scraping workflow:
  * [Web scraping with R](https://williammarble.co/files/webscraping_tutorial/webscraping_tutorial.pdf) by William Marble
  * [Web scraping using R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2515245919859535) by Alex Bradley and Richard J. E. James

<!--
Install on your web browser (e.g. Chrome), the "selector gadget" and explore how to use to select tags (see slides)
-->

Several packages are needed for this and next lecture. They are all installed on R workbench. If you are using R from your laptop (VS. R Workbench), I'd suggest following the scraping lectures using Workbench.
