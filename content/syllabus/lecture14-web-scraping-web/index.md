## Overview

* Understand the difference between web-scraping and Application Program Interface (API)
* Define HTML and CSS selectors
* Introduce the `rvest` package for scraping in R
* Demonstrate how to extract information from HTML pages
* Practice scraping data


## Before class

Several packages are needed for this and next lectures on the topic. They are all already installed on R Workbench. But if you are using R from your laptop (VS. R Workbench), I'd suggest following the scraping lectures using Workbench. 

<!--
Explore the readings and Install on your web browser (e.g., Chrome), the "Selector Gadget" tool, and explore how to use it to select tags.
