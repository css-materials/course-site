## Overview

* Continue the lecture on scraping and introduce new concepts
* Introduce scraping with Application Program Interfaces (APIs)

<!--
* Explain APIs authentication keys and methods for storing these keys
* Interact with APIs

NOTES FALL 2024 FOR NEXT TIME
review the tutorial on scraping part 2 which is currently in class materials
make it more efficient, e.g. if else statements, or make both base url in one go (one for the 10 links per each page, and one for the 476 pages) etc. then rewrite it with some practice exercises; needs a few hours of work

this time I spent both lectures on scraping on this example, consider setting aside 30 min or so for another scraping example, and mention html_table() explicitly

I did not get to start APIs this time, so I can just move it to the next lecture altogheter in future iterations

## Readings

Readings for all lectures on the topic (both direct web-scraping and scraping using APIs) are posted under Lecture 14.
