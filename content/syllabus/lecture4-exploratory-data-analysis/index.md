<!-- NOTES FOR ME FALL 2024 PLANNING
NEEDS REVIEW: Add in-class exercise on matching plot with variable type (see Kelsey on this: https://american-stat-412612.netlify.app/material/). 
Review last slides from factors and move here materials currently in lecture 5
-->

## Overview

* Define Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Match appropriate graph types with variable types

<!--
## Before class
* Make sure you have accepted and cloned the repo for [Homework 2](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/homework/explore-data/)
-->


## Readings

* ["Chapter 10 Exploratory Data Analysis"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition.
* Review the resources and readings posted under Lecture 2 on `ggplot2` and data visualization (we will use `ggplot2` extensively in this lecture)


## Class materials

<!-- 
In-class materials (exercises and code) will be posted here shortly before class.
-->

Run the code below in your console to download todayâ€™s materials: `usethis::use_course("css-materials/exploratory-data-analysis")`

* [Practice exploring college education data](/notes/exploratory-data-analysis-practice/)

## Additional resources

* Antony Unwin [Graphical Data Analysis with R](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/11609643#). It covers a range of graphical methods for data exploration and analysis; draws on packages beyond `ggplot2` for statistical graphics.
* Cheat Sheet [Data visualization with ggplot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf)

* From the lecture on data wrangling, on factors: [Practice transforming and visualizing factors](/notes/factors-exercise/)
