<!-- NOTES FOR ME FALL 2024 PLANNING
NEEDS REVIEW: Remove materials on Factors from here and slides; 
use tutorial from last time and add more examples or in-class activity
Might add here from Summer: tutorial/demo on how to improve bar chart from lecture 4 (EDA) 
-->


## Overview

* Review the fundamental `dplyr` "verbs" for data manipulation and learn new ones
* Practice using `dplyr` verbs
* Data cleaning: recoding and renaming variables; syntactic vs. non-non-syntactic variable names
* Data cleaning: missing data and duplicates


## Readings

* Review ["Chapter 3 Data transformation"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. This is the same chapter from the`dplyr` lecture (lecture 3), you might want to take a look again.
* Read ["Chapter 18 Missing values"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values.html) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition.
