## Overview

* Define and use factors in R
* Review the fundamental `dplyr` "verbs" for data manipulation (see Lecture 3) and learn new ones
* Data cleaning: recoding and renaming variables; difference between syntactic vs. non-syntactic variable names
* Data cleaning: missing data


## Readings

Required:
* Review ["Chapter 16 Factors"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. 
* Review ["Chapter 3 Data transformation"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. This is the same chapter from the `dplyr` lecture (lecture 3), you might want to take a look again.

Optional/Skim:
* ["Chapter 18 Missing values"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values.html) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. Not immediately relevant, but offers several tips that could be beneficial for your future work.
