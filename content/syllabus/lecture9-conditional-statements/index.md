<!-- NOTES FALL 2024
I split the original lecture (one) into two: one is this on conditional statements which needs more work; the other is on loops for which there is already enough material. 

TO DO: Remember to create the new slides for one of these + spit and fix the in-class materials for each lecture

Follow these notes from control structures slides 

IDEA for next time: split this into two

lecture 1: review data structure / base R + conditional statements (and add more in-class practice and how to do conditional statements with a dataframe, use penguins_clean!)

lecture 2: loops slides and demo + loop exercises + maps/across + while loops. When you teach for loops add the break and continue statements (currently not in slides!)

NB: in the demo for loop add data structure, e.g. show how to access columns of a df and their elements with the double and single square brakes 

-->

## Overview

* Define control structures
* Introduce conditional statements
* Practice using conditional statements in R


## Readings

* Read [Chapter 13 “Control Structures”](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/control-structures.html) in "R programming for Data Science" (Notice this is not our regular book!)


## Class materials

In-class materials (exercises and code) will be posted here shortly before class.
