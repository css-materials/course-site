## Overview

* Introduce tidyr functions to extract data from strings
* Introduce regular expressions
* Practice using regular expressions in R


## Before class

* Read [Chapter 14.4 "Extracting data from strings"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/strings#extracting-data-from-strings) in "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition.
* Read [Chapter 17](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html#the-stringr-package) from *R Programming for Data Science*. This book covers the entire range of regular expressions packages and functions: you do not need to understand everything, only focus on the big picture. In-class we talk about `stringr()`


## Additional Resources

* [`stringr()` documentation and cheatsheet](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)
* [Chapter 15](https://plsc-31101.github.io/course/strings-and-regular-expressions.html#applying-regex) by Rochelle Terman, explains `stringr()` (using the *R for Data Science* textbook)  


## Class materials 

TBA. In-class materials (code, exercises, etc.) will be posted right before class.
