## Overview

* Define Strings, Regular Expressions, and their uses
* Introduce the `stringr()` package
* Practice using Regular Expressions in R to extract info from strings


## Before class

* Read [Chapter 14 "Strings"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/strings) in "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition (read it all, but especially 14.4 "Extracting data from strings").
* Read [Chapter 17](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html#the-stringr-package) from *R Programming for Data Science*. This book covers the entire range of regular expressions packages and functions: you do not need to understand everything, focus on the big picture. In-class we talk about `stringr()`


## Additional Resources

* [`stringr()` documentation and cheatsheet](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)
* [Chapter 15](https://plsc-31101.github.io/course/strings-and-regular-expressions.html#applying-regex) by Rochelle Terman, explains `stringr()` (using the *R for Data Science* textbook)
