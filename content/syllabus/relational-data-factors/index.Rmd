## Overview

* Dig deeper into `dplry` for data transformation
* Introduce how to use `dplry` for relational data (e.g., linking and merging related tables)


## Before class

Readings
* Read Chapter 13 "Relational Data" in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Do not complete exercises 13.4.6.2-3 -- we will be completing these as in-class exercises
* Review Chapter 15 "Factors" in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Mix
* Complete the in-class exercises from last lecture on tidy data; solutions will be pushed before class
* Fill out [this 2-min survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdymbNtgrQFHgMzqPjxcpIjYqPSFvNBPohQnjtkr4GvFjRFBg/viewform) about the course 
* Questions about your HW1 feedback? book OH with Sabrina or catch her after class (if so, email her first)
