## Overview

* Introduce regular expressions
* Practice using regular expressions in R


## Before class

* Read [Chapter 17](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html#the-stringr-package) from *R Programming for Data Science*. This book covers the entire range of regular expressions packages and functions; in-class we focus only on the `stringr()` package


## Additional Resources

* [`stringr()` documentation and cheatsheet](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)
* [Chapter 14](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#strings) of our textbook *R for Data Science* 
* [Chapter 15](https://plsc-31101.github.io/course/strings-and-regular-expressions.html#applying-regex) by Rochelle Terman, explains `stringr()` (using the *R for Data Science* textbook)
