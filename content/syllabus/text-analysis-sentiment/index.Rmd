## Overview

* Identify the basic workflow for conducting text analysis
* Define the tidy text formats (Chapter 1)
* Word frequencies and tf-idf (Chapter 1 and 3)
* Relationship between words (Chapter 4)

Goal of today's and next class: not to become expert in these methods, but to gain an understanding of what can be done with text mining (and further explore some of these topics for your last homework assignment, if you would like)

* Demonstrate how to conduct sentiment analysis using twitter
* Explain how to generate and interpret a wordcloud -->


## Before class

For this and the following lecture we use the book [*Tidy Text Mining with R*](http://tidytextmining.com/):
* Before this class: read Chapter 1, 3, and 4
* Before next class: read chapters 2, 5, and 6

## Additional resources

* The three case studies included in the book "Text Mining with R" (see assigned readings) provide in-depth examples on how to preform text analysis from A-Z. I recommend Chapter 9  [Case study: analyzing usenet text](https://www.tidytextmining.com/usenet.html)
* For an excellent theoretical explanation of these topics see [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin, especially Chapter 2, 3, and 4
