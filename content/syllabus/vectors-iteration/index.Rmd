## Overview

<!--
* Review the major types of vectors
* Demonstrate how to subset vectors
* Demonstrate vector recycling
* Define lists
-->

* Introduce if-else statements
* Introduce iterative operations
* Practice writing iterative operations using loops, `map()` functions, and `dplyr::across()`

## Before class

* Read Chapter 13 “Control Structures” in [R programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/control-structures.html) 
* Read Chapter 21 "Iteration” in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) 

<!--
* Read chapters 14.1-2, 20-21 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
-->
