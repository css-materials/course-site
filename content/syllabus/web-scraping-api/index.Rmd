## Overview

* Review main concepts in webscraping
* Define Application Program Interface (API)
* Explain APIs authentication keys and demonstrate secure methods for storing these keys
* Interact with APIs
* Define JSON data structure and how to convert them to data frames

<!--
* Practice tidying messy JSON data objects using `tidyr`
* Demonstrate how to use canned packages in R to access APIs
* Practice gathering data from Twitter API using the `rtweet` package in R
-->

## Before class

Review Monday's class materials and especially:

* install the selector gadget and explore how to use it (see [this slide](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/slides/getting-data-from-the-web-scraping/#43)): it is a handy tool that  makes it easier to select the right tags
* if things in Monday's slides are unclear: come to class with your questions or post them on Ed (I will answer them in-class)
* complete Monday's in-class exercises
* review the readings (there are no new readings for today)

Please notice, several packages are needed for this week's lectures, and they are all installed on R workbench. If you are using R from your laptop (VS. Workbench), I'd suggest following the lectures using Workbench and installing the packages after class.
