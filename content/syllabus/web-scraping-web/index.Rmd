## Overview

* Define HTML and CSS selectors
* Introduce the `rvest` package
* Demonstrate how to extract information from HTML pages
* Practice scraping data

## Before class

* Chapter 1 and 4 in [Web Scraping with R](https://steviep42.github.io/webscraping/book/)

Several packages are needed for this week's lectures (all installed on R workbench). If you are using R from your laptop (VS. R Workbench), I'd suggest following the lectures using R Workbench and installing the packages after class.
