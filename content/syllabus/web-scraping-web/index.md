## Overview

* Identify multiple methods for obtaining data from the internet
* Define web-scraping and Application Program Interface (API) 
* Define HTML and CSS selectors
* Introduce the `rvest` package
* Demonstrate how to extract information from HTML pages
* Practice scraping data

## Before class

* Chapter 1 and 4 in [Web Scraping with R](https://steviep42.github.io/webscraping/book/)

Additional readings (these are two short optional articles that summarize the scraping workflow):
* [Web scraping with R](https://williammarble.co/files/webscraping_tutorial/webscraping_tutorial.pdf) by William Marble
* [Web scraping using R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2515245919859535) by Alex Bradley and Richard J. E. James

Several packages are needed for this week's lectures (all installed on R workbench). If you are using R from your laptop (VS. R Workbench), I'd suggest following the lectures using R Workbench and installing the packages after class.
