##  A Roadmap to Base R

---

### What is Base R

It means things like:
* data structures (vectors, matrices, list, data frames, etc.); `class()`
* data types (numeric, integer, character, logical, factor); `typeof()`
* operations (indexing/subsetting, arithmetic operations)
* programming techniques (if-else, loops, functions)

<!-- 
ON DATA STRUCTURES AND DATA TYPES
In many cases, the choice of data structure in R determines the data type(s) that can be stored within it. 
Vectors and matrices typically hold elements of a single data type (e.g., numeric, character).
Lists can hold elements of different data types within each list element. 

TODAY
we do the first three points today
on programming techniques we have seen some yesterday and we come back to functions on Monday  
-->


---

### Base R and the tidyverse

**Base R** 
* R as programming language was developed in the early 1990s 
* includes key commands that you can use together with the `tidyverse`
* uses CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network): central repository for R packages

**Tidyverse**
* collection of packages developed after the 2000s (`ggplot2` 2007, `dplyr` 2009, `tidyr` 2014, etc.) 
* powerful for data wrangling and analysis; generates clean and easy to read code
* builds on base R and also uses CRAN

**Takeaway: use the `tidyverse` but know how base R works!**

---

## R Data Types and Data Structures

We clarify the difference between these two terms, and mostly focus on data structures (there is not a lot to say on data types, beside remembering them!)

<!-- notes:
this is a new lecture that focuses on a general review of data structures
from the original lecture ("vectors-and-iteration") I kept the vectors and lists here 
and I need to enlarge this lecture with more data structures
I do not think I need all libraries listed there, double check

add tidyverse examples here with penguisn for example
add stuff from old Lecture 2 (`introR_lecture`) to define, subset, and manipulate these data structures
add stuff from base R in 2nd ed book
-->

---

### R Data Types: type of data that a variable/object can hold

* numeric
* character
* logical
* *factor*
* *date/time*

--

```{r}
x <- 4
y <- 4.1
z <- "4.1"
j <- TRUE
typeof(x) # repeat for all other data types!
```

<!-- sapply(list(x, y, z, j), typeof) -->

Often the choice of **data structure** in R determines the **data type(s)** that can be stored within it... 
<!--
So let's talk about data structures! 
Vectors and matrices: hold elements of a single data type (e.g., numeric, character).
Lists and df: can hold elements of different data types within each list element. -->

---

### R Data Structures: the way data is stored

* Vectors
* Matrices
* Lists
* Data frames (in the `tidyverse`: tibbles)
* Arrays

---

### R Data Structures: organization

*These data structures can be organized by:

- their dimensions: 
  * 1d: vectors
  * 2d: matrices and data frames
  * nd: lists and arrays
  
- the data type of their content:
  * homogeneous: all contents must be of the same data type, like (atomic) vectors and matrices
  * heterogeneous: contents can be of different data types, like lists and data frames

--

Next slides: review these data structures, how to subset them (taking elements from them), and arithmetic operations we can do with them!

<!-- we review them all but particular importance on vectors 
In R everything is a vector...
* Review the major types of vectors
* Demonstrate how to subset vectors
* Demonstrate vector recycling
-->

---

#### Vector: 1d, can have heterogeneous elements (different types)

```{r}
num_vec <- c(1:9)
#num_vec <- seq(from = 1, to = 9)
#num_vect <- rep(1:9, each = 1)
dim(num_vec)
class(num_vec)
typeof(num_vec)
```


```{r}
mix_vec <- c(1, "two", 3.4)
dim(mix_vec)
```

---

####  Matrix: 2d, only homogeneous elements (same type)
```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
dim(mat)
```

---

#### List: nd, can have heterogeneous elements (different types)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
lst <- list(
  num_vec = c(1:9),
  mat = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE),
  another_num_v = c(1,2,4),
  char_v = c("Sabrina", "Mónica"),
  df = tibble(var_1 = c(1:4),
              var_2 = c(2:5))
)

dim(lst) # no fixed dimension! 

dim(lst$mat)
dim(lst[[2]])
```

<!-- when to use each?

vector and df: lots of times! 

matrix: matrix algebra operations

lists: if pox use df and other data structures outside it, but can be useful to set up loops, 
more generally when you need flexibility and storage of differnt data structures
--> 

---

#### Data frame: 2nd, can have heterogeneous elements (different types)
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:3,
  name = c("Sabrina", "Mónica", "Lucas"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35)
)
dim(df)
```

---

#### Tibble: same as data frame!
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  name = c("Sabrina", "Mónica", "Lucas"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35)
)

dim(df)

```

---

```{r}
# extract a list from penguins
```

```{r}
# extract a vectorr from penguins
```


---

<!-- add subsetting vectors, matrix, lists + operations iwth each -->


---

### R is a vector-based program

So far, we have been using predominantly data frames (technically tibbles!), which are very common when working with social science data. 

However, data frames are not the most fundamental type of object in R: **vectors are the ultimate building blocks of objects in R...**

* a matrix is made of vectors
* a list is made of vectors (a list is still a vector in R but not an atomic one)
* a data frame is made of lists

<!-- Basically in R either something is a vector, or it's NULL... -->

# Atomic vectors 

When people say "vectors" they usually mean "atomic vectors": the building blocks of R!

---

#### Types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, character

* logical vector
* numeric vector 
  * integer vector
  * double vector
* character vector

Key takeway: **All values in an atomic vector must to be of the same type**.

---

### Types of atomic vectors: logical

**Logical**: you have used it every time you use a conditional test or operation (e.g., when you filter a data frame)
```{r parse-logical, collapse = TRUE}
logical_vector <- c("TRUE", "TRUE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "NA")
```

```{r}
# add penguin example
```


---

### Types of atomic vectors: numeric

**Numeric**: can be integer or double (default)
```{r parse-numeric, collapse = TRUE}
integer_vector <- c("1", "5", "3", "4", "12423")
double_vector <- c("4.2", "4", "6", "53.2")
```

---

### Types of atomic vectors: numeric

**Character**: note you can use single or double quotations, you just need to be consistent
```{r parse-character, collapse = TRUE}
character_vector <- c("Scary", "'1,2,3 ready!'", "Halloween", '10/31/2022')
```

---

### Types of atomic vector: scalar

In math a scalar is defined as a single real number. R has no concept of a scalar: **in R, a scalar is simply a vector of length 1**

```{r recycle}
# set up a vector x of length 10
(x <- sample(10))

# add 100 to x
x + c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100)

# add 100 to x: the R way (vector recycling)
x + 100
```

<!-- The second way to add the numbers is more efficient but can also be dangerous...-->

---

### Vector Recycling

When two vectors are involved in an operation, **R repeats the elements of the shorter vector to match the length of the longer vector**.

For example, let's define two numeric vectors `x1` and `x2`:
```{r recycle-bad}
# x1 is sequence of numbers from 1 to 2
(x1 <- seq(from = 1, to = 2))

# x2 is a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10
(x2 <- seq(from = 1, to = 10))
```

---

### Vector Recycling

If we add `x1` and `x2` together, R will do it, but the result might not be what we expect:
```{r}
(x1 + x2)
```

The shorter vector `x1` is duplicated five times in order to match the length of the longer vector `x2.` 

The same behavior is for other operations like subtraction, multiplication, logical comparison, etc.

---

### Vector Recycling

```{r}
(x1 - x2)
```

```{r}
(x1 * x2)
```

---

### Vector Recycling

This behavior is called **vector recycling** and happens automatically in R. You need check if this is what you intended to do. If not, extend the length of the shorter vector manually first, then add them up.

```{r}
(x1 <- c(1, 2, rep(0, 7)))
```

```{r}
(x1 + x2)
```

**Note that if the shorter vector is not a multiple of the longer one, R will print a warning message!**

---

### Subsetting vectors: slicing

To subset a vector we use the index location of its elements:

```{r subset-vec}
x <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
```

```
# keep the first element
x[1]

# keep the first through third elements
x[c(1, 2, 3)]   # long way
x[1:3]          # shorter
x[c(seq(1, 3))] # sequence 
x[-c(4:5)]      # negative indexing (values that you do not want to keep)
x[-c(4,5)]      # negative indexing

x[c(-1,2,3)]   # error! do not mix negative and positive subscripts
```

---

### Subset with a logical vector: conditional subsetting

Sometimes, rather than slicing, like we did in the previous example, we want to keep certain values based of a **condition**. 

This is more similar to a filtering operation (vs. slicing) and it is a 2-step operation:
1. create a logical vector of TRUEs and FALSEs, that identifies for each of the elements in the original vector, which one we want to keep

2. apply that vector to the vector we want to subset 

---

### Subset with a logical vector: conditional subsetting

Given a vector `x`:
```{r subset-logic}
x <- c(NA, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1, NA)
```

We want to keep all the non-missing values in `x`. To find them we can use `is.na()`. This function outputs a logical vector of TRUEs and FALSEs.
Notice the `!` reverts the output, so we get TRUE for non-missing and FALSE for missing values -- we want to keep the TRUEs:
```{r}
!is.na(x)
```

Then, we put the function into `[]` to apply it to our `x` vector. This says "keep all elements that are TRUE" in this vector:
```{r}
x[!is.na(x)]
```

---

### Subset with a logical vector: conditional subsetting

This applies to any kind of conditional test. For example, given the same vector `x`:
```{r}
x <- c(NA, 10, 3, 5, 8, 1, NA)
```

We might want to get all even or missing values of `x`. To do so, we first use modular division: 
```{r}
x %% 2 == 0 
```

Then, we apply it to our vector `x`:
```{r}
x[x %% 2 == 0]
```

# Lists

## Lists

Lists are another type of vector, but they are not atomic vector. They differ from atomic vectors in two main ways:

1. They **store heterogeneous elements** (vs. all values in an atomic vector must be of the same type)
2. They **are structured differently** and are created with the `list()` function, not with the `c()` function. Notice the output is different than the output from an atomic vector:
```{r list}
x <- list(1, 2, 3)
x
```

---

## Lists structure

List objects are structured as a list of **independent elements**. Use `str()` to see their structure: 
```{r str}
x <- list(1, 2, 3)
str(x)
```

Here we have a list of length 3, and each of the elements of this list is a numeric atomic vector of length 1.

---

## Lists elements

Unlike atomic vectors, lists can contain **multiple data types**, and we can also name each of them:
```{r}
x_named <- list(a = "abc", b = 2, c = c(1, 2, 3))
str(x_named)
```
Here we have a list of length 3, and each of the elements of this list is a different object: we have a character vector of length 1, one numeric vector of length 1, and one numeric vector of length 3. 

---

## Nested lists

You can also store lists inside a list: **nested list structure**. 

In this object `z` we have two lists:
```{r list-list}
z <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
str(z)
```

This is often useful when you interact with API to get data from the web (frequently you get this type of nested list as output when you get data from API).

---

## Secret lists: data frames!

Notice, we have been using lists extensively in the class. Each column of a data frame is a list: 
```{r list-df}
str(gun_deaths)
```

The only difference between data frames and actual lists is that the length of each list object in the data frame has to the same (a data frame is rectangular).

---

## Subsetting lists

Lists have a more complex structure than vectors, thus subsetting them also requires more attention.

.pull-left[

For example, `a` is a list that contains four elements: 
* a numeric vector
* a character vector
* a numeric vector
* a list object which in turns contains two distinct numeric vectors (notice the space in the middle)

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
include_graphics(path = "lists-subsetting-a-only.png")
```

]

---

## Subsetting lists

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics(path = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/lists-subsetting.png")
```
