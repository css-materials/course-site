## `penguins`

[Meet the Palmer Penguins!]( https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/#meet-the-palmer-penguins)

The palmerpenguins package (already installed on Workbench) contains two datasets:

* `penguins`: clean data on three species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) from three islands in Antartica; total data 244 penguins 

* `penguins_raw`: raw data 

We will be using the `penguins` data today.
---

## `penguins`

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins)
```

--

If I ask you: *What is the average body mass of an Adelie penguin?*... What are the conceptual steps that you need to take to answer this questions, and do you translate them into R code?

<!-- envision the result: will be one single number, that is the mean of Adelie penguins body mass! -->


---

### What is the average body mass of an Adelie penguin?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Conceptual]

1. First, we need to identify the **input** aka the data: `penguins`
1. Next, we need to **filter** only the observations classified as `species` Adelie
1. Finally, we need to calculate the average value, or **mean**, of the variable `body_mass_g`

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(penguins, 5)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r avg-mass-adelie, echo = TRUE}
data(penguins)
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie")
summarize(.data = penguins_adelie, avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

]
]

---

### What is the average body mass of a penguin for each species?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Conceptual]

1. First, we need to identify the **input** aka the data: `penguins`
1. Next, we need to **group** the observations by `species`
1. Finally, we need to calculate the average value, or **mean**, of the variable `body_mass_g`

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins, 5)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r avg-mass-species, echo = TRUE}
data(penguins)
penguins_species <- group_by(.data = penguins, species)
summarize(.data = penguins_species, avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

]
]

<!--
table(penguins$species)

Before we dig deeper into dplyr useful to know operator in R because you will need to use operators a lot with dplyr, for example with filter

# Operators

---

### Assignment Operators
```
x <- 5    # store value into a variable
x = 5     # pass a value to a function's argument
```

--

```
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins)
```

---

### Logical Operators
```
x == x    # is equal (TRUE or FALSE)
x != y    # is not equal (TRUE or FALSE) 
x < y     # less than
x <= y    # less than or equal to 
y > x     # more than
y >=      # more than or equal to
```

--

```
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie")
```

--

```
penguins_no_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species != "Adelie")
```

--

```
penguins_heavy <- filter(.data = penguins, body_mass_g > 4500)
```


---

### More Logical Operators
```
x | y     # x OR y
x & y     # x AND y
x &! y    # x AND NOT Y
```

--

--

Using extended syntax:
```
penguins_ad_ch <- filter(.data = penguins, 
                       species == "Adelie" | species == "Chinstrap")
```

Using %in% syntax:
```
penguins_ad_ch <- filter(.data = penguins, species %in% c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"))
                
```
<!-- ask: compare the two code, what do you notice?:
parentheses
.data
what arguments does filter take

-->

--

In all these codes (here and before), we can directly pass the data name like this:
```
penguins_ad_ch <- filter(penguins, species %in% c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"))
                
```


---

### PRACTICE: Using operators with dplyr `filter()`

```{r cache = FALSE}
#countdown(minutes = 5)
```

TASK 1: Get all Adelie penguins with flipper length longer or equal than 180


TASK 2: Get all female penguins on the Dream island with body mass between 3000 and 4000 included 


TASK 3: Get all penguins on the Dream and Torgersen islands that are not female

<!--

I am going to type that in R the first two, and you tell me what to type!

### PRACTICE: Using operators with dplyr `filter()`

TASK 1: Get all Adelie penguins with flipper length longer or equal than 180

```
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

# filter only
filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie" & flipper_length_mm >= 180)

# filter and save in adelie_fl_180 variabel

# count
nrow(adelie_fl_180)
count(adelie_fl_180)
```


TASK 2: Select all female penguins on the Dream island with body mass between 3000 and 4000 included 

```
filter(penguins, sex == "female" & island == "Dream" & body_mass_g %in% 3000:4000) 
```
OR

```
filter(penguins, sex == "female" & island == "Dream" & between(body_mass_g, 3000, 4000))
```

TASK 3: Get all penguins on the Dream and Torgersen islands that are not female

filter(penguins, island %in% c("Dream", "Torgersen") & sex != "female")
filter(penguins, island %in% c("Dream", "Torgersen") & sex == "male")

filter(penguins, (island == "Dream" | island == "Torgersen") & sex != "female")

### Flow for data transformation

Conceptually, we have learned that to perform data transformations we need to:
1. Get the data frame
1. Use `dplyr` verbs/functions to tell R what to do with the data frame
1. Generate a new data frame with the result 

--

### `dplyr` is our main tool for data transformation in R! 

It contains useful functions that:

* work like grammatical verbs: define actions to be performed on the data
* the noun is the data, and the verb is acting on the noun

*There are many dplr verbs! Memorize the most important ones (next slide) and look up others as needed*

---

These are the **main verbs** you will use to transform your data. By **combining them together**, you can perform powerful data manipulation tasks.

`function()`  | Action performed
--------------|--------------------------------------------------------
`filter()`    | Picks observations from the data frame based on their values (operates on rows)
`arrange()`   | Changes the order of observations based on their values
`select()`    | Picks variables from the data frame based on their names (operates on columns)
`rename()`    | Changes the name of columns in the data frame
`mutate()`    | Creates new columns from existing ones
`group_by()`  | Changes the unit of analysis from the complete data frame to individual groups
`summarize()` | Collapses the data frame to a smaller number of rows to summarize the larger data

---

### American vs. British English

`dplyr` accepts both spellings, but just for clarity:

* US `summarize()` = UK `summarise()`

* US `color()` = UK `colour()`

### PRACTICE: What is the average bill length and body mass for each Adelie penguin by sex?

```{r cache = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

---

### Solution 1: group by, then filter

```{r adelie-group-filter, echo = TRUE}
penguins_sex <- group_by(.data = penguins, sex)
penguins_sex_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins_sex, species == "Adelie")
summarize(
  .data = penguins_sex_adelie,
  avg_bill = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

---

### Solution 2: filter, then group by

```{r adelie-filter-group, echo = TRUE}
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins_adelie_sex <- group_by(.data = penguins_adelie, sex)
summarize(
  .data = penguins_adelie_sex,
  avg_bill = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

---

### Saving transformed data

```{r knit-change, cache = FALSE, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Printed, but not saved]

```{r print}
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Saved, but not printed]

```{r save}
diamonds_ideal <- filter(.data = diamonds, cut == "Ideal")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Saved and printed]

```{r print-save}
(diamonds_ideal <- filter(.data = diamonds, cut == "Ideal"))

# Pipes `%>%` or `|>`

---

### Pipes `%>%`  or `|>`


> Pipes in R allow you to write a sequence of multiple operations by **passing the result of one function to another one, in sequence** 


Pipes simplify your code and make your operations more intuitive, BUT they are not the only way to write your R code. In fact, R didn't have pipes for a long time!

*Let's look at ways you can write the same code with and without pipes...*

---

### Pipes `%>%`  or `|>`

Imagine we are given the following task:
**using the penguins dataset, calculate the average body mass for Adelie penguins on different islands**

First, THINK: break down the problem into smaller steps
1. Filter penguins to only keep observations where `species` is Adelie
1. Group the filtered penguins by `island`
1. Summarize the grouped and filtered penguins by calculating the average body mass

Then, ACT: How do we implement the code?

---

### Option 1: save each step in a new data frame

```{r no-pipes-new}
penguins_1 <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins_2 <- group_by(penguins_1, island)
penguins_3 <- summarize(penguins_2, body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
print(penguins_3)
```

--

This is valid code. Drawback: we have to save each intermediate object. Here each intermediate object is named with a number to the end, which is not good self-documentation (we must remember that the data exists at each step and reference the correct one). 
---

### Option 2: replace the original data frame

```{r no-pipes-replace}
penguins <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins <- group_by(penguins, island)
(penguins <- summarize(penguins, body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

--

Instead of creating intermediate objects, we can overwrite the original data frame with the modified one. This is valid code. Drawback: if we make an error in the middle of the process, we need to re-do the entire operation from the beginning.

---

### Option 3: function composition

```{r no-pipes-fcomp}
data(penguins)
summarize(group_by(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), island), 
          body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

--

This is valid code. Drawback: this code is hard to read (since we need to read it from the inside out) and is prone to errors.

---

### Option 4: pipes

```{r with-pipes}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

--

This is valid and clear code! Notice the clearer syntax and the focus on **actions**, not objects.

Pipes **chains a series of functions together**: they automatically pass the output from the first function to the next one as the input, producing code that is easily readable by humans.

## Piping (`%>%`)

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[No pipes]

```{r no-pipe}
by_dest <- group_by(
  .data = flights,
  dest
)

delays <- summarise(
  .data = by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)

delays <- filter(
  .data = delays,
  count > 20,
  dest != "HNL"
)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[With pipes]

```{r pipe}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    count > 20,
    dest != "HNL"
  )
```

]

]
-->

---

### Common pipes errors: examples with `flights` data

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
head(flights)
```

This is a dataset of all flights (n = 336,776) that departed from NYC in 2013.

---

### Common pipes errors: example 1

TASK: Get all flights that arrived late, group them by destination, and calculate their average delay; remove destinations with less than 20 total flights.

--

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code

```
delays <- flights %>% 
  by_dest <- group_by(dest) %>% 
  delay <- summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  d <- filter(count > 20)
```

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r echo = TRUE}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

Don’t assign anything within the pipes: **don't not use <- inside the piped operation** for intermediate steps. Only use it at the beginning, if you want to save the output.

---

### Common pipes errors: example 2

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code

```
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest)
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

Remember to **add the pipe at the end of each line involved in the piped operation.**


---

### Common pipes errors: example 3

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code

```
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(.data = flights, dest) %>% 
  summarize(.data = flights,
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(.data = flights, count > 20)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]


When using pipes, **only reference the data frame at the beginning of the pipe sequence**; you don't need to reference it with each function.

---

### Common pipes errors: example 4

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code


```
delays <- flights +
  group_by(dest) +
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) +
  filter(count > 20)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

**Don't use the `+` sign:** we are not adding layers to create a graph here like in `ggplot2`. Here are using several `dplyr` functions to transform data.
