# Operators

---

### Assignment Operators
```
x <- 5    # store value into a variable
x = 5     # pass a value to a function's argument
```

--

```
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins)
```

---

### Logical Operators
```
x == x    # is equal (TRUE or FALSE)
x != y    # is not equal (TRUE or FALSE) 
x < y     # less than
x <= y    # less than or equal to 
y > x     # more than
y >=      # more than or equal to
```

--

```
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie")
```

--

```
penguins_no_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species != "Adelie")
```

--

```
penguins_heavy <- filter(.data = penguins, body_mass_g > 4500)
```


---

### More Logical Operators
```
x | y     # x OR y
x & y     # x AND y
x &! y    # x AND NOT Y
```

--

--

Using extended syntax:
```
penguins_set <- filter(.data = penguins, 
                       species == "Adelie" | species == "Chinstrap")
```

Using %in% syntax:
```
penguins_set <- filter(.data = penguins, species %in% c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"))
                
```


---

### PRACTICE: Using operators

```{r cache = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

Task 1: Select all Adelie penguins with flipper length longer or equal than 180


Task 2: Select all female penguins on the "Dream" island with body mass between 3000 and 4000 included 


---

### PRACTICE: Using operators

Task 1: Select all Adelie penguins with flipper length longer or equal than 180

```
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie" & flipper_length_mm >= 180)
```

Task 2: Select all female penguins on the "Dream" island with body mass between 3000 and 4000 included 

```
filter(penguins,island == "Dream" & body_mass_g %in% 3000:4000) 
```

```
filter(penguins, island == "Dream" & between(body_mass_g, 3000, 4000))
```

### Flow for data transformation

Conceptually we have seen that to perform some data transformation we need:
1. Get the data frame
1. Use verbs/functions to tell R what to do with the data frame
1. The result is a new data frame

--

The `dplyr` package contains useful functions that:
* work like grammatical verbs: define actions to be performed on the data
* the noun is the data, and the verb is acting on the noun

---

### Key functions in `dplyr`


`function()`  | Action performed
--------------|--------------------------------------------------------
`filter()`    | Picks observations from the data frame based on their values (operates on rows)
`arrange()`   | Changes the order of observations based on their values
`select()`    | Picks variables from the data frame based on their names (operates on columns)
`rename()`    | Changes the name of columns in the data frame
`mutate()`    | Creates new columns from existing ones
`group_by()`  | Changes the unit of analysis from the complete data frame to individual groups
`summarize()` | Collapses the data frame to a smaller number of rows to summarize the larger data

These are the basic verbs you will commonly use to transform your data (but there is more). By **combining them together**, you can perform powerful data manipulation tasks.

### American vs. British English

* US `summarize()` = UK `summarise()`
* US `color()` = UK `colour()`

# Variables name

---

## Syntactic column names

Normally within tidyverse functions, we can refer to column names directly. For example:

```{r colname-normal-intro}
count(x = diamonds, color)
```

Here `color` is a column of the `diamonds` data frame. It has a **syntactic name**, so we can refer to it directly. This won't work for any column name that is non-syntactic. 


---

.pull-left[

### Syntactic names


A **syntactic name** is what R considers a **valid name** and consists of letters, digits, . and `_` but it can’t begin with symbols or a with a digit

```
social_conservative
social.conservative
ideology_7_point
id
```

]

--

.pull-right[

### Non-syntactic names

A **non-syntactic name** is what R does not consider a valid name, or a name that uses a reserved word in R like TRUE, NULL, if, and function (see the complete list in `?Reserved`) 

```
social conservative
social_ conservative
social-conservative
7-point ideology
_id
if
```

]

--

You **do not want to deliberately create non-syntactic names**, BUT you need to understand how they work because you’ll come across them when working with social sciences data (for ex. if the data that has been created outside R)

---

### Referring to non-syntactic names: use backticks not quotes

Example 1
```
7-point ideology <- c("communism", "anarchism", "fascism")
Error: unexpected symbol in "7-point ideology"
```

```{r}
`7-point ideology` <- c("communism", "anarchism", "fascism")
```

Example 2
```
if <- 10
Error: unexpected assignment in "if <-"
```

```{r}
`if` <- 10
```

# Pipes `%>%`

---

## Pipes `%>%`


> Pipes in R allow you to write a sequence of multiple operations by **passing the result of one function to another one, in sequence** 


Pipes simplify your code and make your operations more intuitive, BUT they are not the only way to write your R code... for a long time pipes did not even exist in R!

Let's look at ways you can write the same code with and without pipes

---


## Pipes `%>%`

Imagine we have the following task:
**using the penguins dataset, calculate the average body mass for Adelie penguins on different islands**

First, think: break down the problem into smaller steps
1. Filter penguins to only keep observations where the species is Adelie
1. Group the filtered penguins by island
1. Summarize the grouped and filtered penguins by calculating the average body mass

Then, act: How do we implement the code?

---

### Option 1: save each step in a new data frame

```{r no-pipes-new}
penguins_1 <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins_2 <- group_by(penguins_1, island)
penguins_3 <- summarize(penguins_2, body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
print(penguins_3)
```
This is valid code. The drawback is that we have to name each intermediate object. Here each intermediate object is named with a number to the end, which is not good self-documentation. We have to remember that the data exists in each intermediate step and remember to reference the correct one. 

---

### Option 2: replace the original data frame

```{r no-pipes-replace}
penguins <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins <- group_by(penguins, island)
(penguins <- summarize(penguins, body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

Instead of creating intermediate objects, we can replace the original data frame with the modified form. This is also valid code. The drawback is that if we make an error in the middle of the operation, we need to rerun the entire operation from the beginning.

---

### Option 3: function composition

```{r no-pipes-fcomp}
data(penguins)
summarize(group_by(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), island), 
          body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This is valid code. The drawback is that this code is hard to read, since we need to read it from the inside out, and prone to errors.

---

### Option 4: pipes

```{r with-pipes}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Notice the clearer syntax and the focus on **actions**, not objects.

Pipes **chains a series of functions together**: they automatically pass the output from the first function the next one as the input, producing code that is easily readable by humans.

<!--

## Piping (`%>%`)

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[No pipes]

```{r no-pipe}
by_dest <- group_by(
  .data = flights,
  dest
)

delays <- summarise(
  .data = by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)

delays <- filter(
  .data = delays,
  count > 20,
  dest != "HNL"
)
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[With pipes]

```{r pipe}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    count > 20,
    dest != "HNL"
  )
```

]

]
-->

---

### Common errors to avoid with pipes: examples using a toy dataset

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
head(flights)
```

This is a dataset of all flights (n = 336,776) that departed from NYC in 2013. See Chapter 5 of our textbook.

---

### Errors to avoid with pipes: example 1

Get all flights that arrived late, group them by destination, and calculate their average delay; remove destinations with less than 20 total flights.

--

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code

```
delays <- flights %>% 
  by_dest <- group_by(dest) %>% 
  delay <- summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  d <- filter(count > 20)
```

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r echo = TRUE}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

Don’t assign anything within the pipes. That is, **don't not use <- inside the piped operation** for intermediate steps. Only use it at the beginning if you want to save the output.

---

### Errors to avoid with pipes: example 2

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code

```
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest)
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

Remember to **add the pipe %>% at the end of each line involved in the piped operation**


---

### Errors to avoid with pipes: example 3

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code

```
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(.data = flights, dest) %>% 
  summarize(.data = flights,
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(.data = flights, count > 20)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

When you use pipes, **don’t reference the data frame with each function**: just the first time at the beginning of the pipe sequence


---

### Errors to avoid with pipes: example 4

.pull-left[

#### Invalid code


```
delays <- flights +
  group_by(dest) +
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) +
  filter(count > 20)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

#### Correct code

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20)
```

]

**Don't use the `+` sign:** we are not adding layers to create a graph here. We are using several `dplyr` functions to transform data

## Homework 2 Overview

## Tips to tackle coding HW assignments
  
- start early!
- do not expect to complete the entire HW in one session
- HWs are a bit more difficult than the in-class/book exercises: make sure you have a good grasp of the in-class and book exercises first
- HWs are cumulative (review previous HW materials)
- jumping right into coding is a bad habit: 
   * take some time to review the readings and class notes
   * take some time to think: how to approach each question into small steps
- form a study group 

**Stuck?**

You are stepping outside your comfort zone: some problems (and frustrations) are expected...
- take a break and come back with fresh eyes
- write down the problem with pen and paper and/or explain it out loud to yourself, your roommate, your dog, cat, etc.
- 15-min rule, google/stackoverflow, ask a classmate and/or the instructional staff
- Use ED Discussion (review our website FAQ before posting a question)
