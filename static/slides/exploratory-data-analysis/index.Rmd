# Agenda

* Overview of Exploratory Data Analysis
* Exploratory VS. Confermatory Data Analysis
* EDA with the `scorecard` dataset
  * variation & co-variation 
  * match type of plot to variable type

<!--
Main takeaways from today's lecture: 
1. match plot to variable type
1. do not stop after one plot... experiment with different visualizations
1. effective use of visuals for EDA often require data transformation (`dplyr` + `ggplot`)

Goals for this time (summer 2024) were (1) to make this lecture more interactive and (2) to improve the message of matching the plot with the right variable types; there is still room for improvement; one idea for next time (fall 2025) is to start with the intro on what is EDA (me lecturing, but also keep the interactive session on other ways to code that penguins example); then start the section titled "EDA with scorecard dataset" with a slide that list s all "tasks" and ask students to code them first, maybe in team of 2 (give specific instructions: identify the type of variables, explain which plot you picked and why, produce the code and put code and plot (copy-paste it?) in this shared document under your "task") 
have students work on it for 10 min then we share insights and compare results; have student share their code on google or something that everyone can see so we can run the plot interactively in class  
might want to increase or vary the difficulty level of tasks and to give an intro to the dataset together before jumping into it
the bulk of the lecture should be this activity

SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT TIME:

say that this is a key lecture and you want to return to it in future hw, including hte last two (hw6 and final project that are more open ended), mostly we want variety in graphs (bar graphs are great but there are other ways to display two cat variables)

show more type of graphs and give an exercise on that

add the vis cheat sheet

the ggplot2 cheatsheet is great for ideas on different types of graph (click on Download pdf)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

### EDA Definition

All set of **INITIAL** investigations to understand your data and generate questions, before running more complex analyses (e.g., modeling). 

Goals: 

+ discover patterns 
+ spot anomalies (outliers)
+ generate questions 
+ check initial hypotheses and formulate new

**Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA** is different from **Explanatory or Confirmatory Data Analysis**

---

### EDA is an iterative and creative process

Our book, "R for Data Science," defines EDA as an **ITERATIVE process**:

1. Generate exploratory questions about your data
1. Search for answers in the data
1. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions
1. Repeat until necessary

--

<br>

I think EDA is a also a **CREATIVE process**. It's not an exact science, and requires curiosity about the data, intuition, and patience. At the most basic level, it involves answering two questions:

* What type of variation occurs within my variable(s)?
* What type of covariation occurs between my variables?


---

### EDA relies on visualizations and descriptive stats

**Visualizations** such histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, etc. 

**Descriptive stats** such as measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation)

--

<br>

**We focus on visualizations, specifically on:**
- Variation: how values within a single variable vary (univariate analysis)
- Covariation: how values of two variables co-vary (bivariate analysis)

--

*Visualizations are employed in both Exploratory and Confirmatory Data Analysis, but their use is different. Let's see an example with the penguins data...* 

<!--
In Exploratory Analysis you might generate 10, 20 or even 100 graphs, but not all of them will be useful for your research. In Confirmatory Analysis, you generate only a few graphs and each graph is well refined and will be put in your final report or research.

# Exploratory VS. Confirmatory Data Analysis

---

## Comparing Exploratory VS. Confirmatory plots

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins")

head(penguins)
```

We want build a plot of two continuous variables: penguins body mass and flipper length.

<!-- Let's build this plot step by step -->

---

```{r penguins-eda, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = flipper_length_mm)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "penguins-eda", break_type = "auto", title = "## Exploratory plot")`

<!-- notice in the code I put the data and mapping above, right after ggplot() because both geometries use the same data and mapping -->

--

Exploratory plot: What does this graph tell us? Pros and cons? And how can we improve it?

<!--
Pros: minimum code, easy to replicate, good for your internal use
Cons: not well refined, not good for publication or external audience
-->

---

```{r penguins-final, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = flipper_length_mm)
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between body mass and\nflipper length of a penguin",
    subtitle = "Sample of 344 penguins",
    x = "Body mass (g)",
    y = "Flipper length (mm)"
  ) +
  theme_xaringan(
    title_font_size = 18,
    text_font_size = 16
  )
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "penguins-final", break_type = "auto", title = "## Confirmatory plot")`

<!-- notice here geom_point and geom_smooth also have their own arguments that work only for them; 
for example:
if I want to make the points of the scatterplot more faded I use alpha there; 
or here I wanted to use a specific method to draw the regression line vs. let R selecting it automatically, so I specify the method and I also do se = FALSE as the default is true and shows the standard error

labs() and theme_xarigan() control the non-data elements of the plot; lab(): controls things like title, subtitles etc; theme() controls background colors, font size, etc.

Notice there is also a geometry that controls titles etc. and it is called geom_text()
Note the difference between `labs()` and `geom_text()` 
Book "`ggplot2`: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" https://ggplot2-book.org/annotations.html

-->

```{r include = FALSE}
# restore default colors
theme_xaringan_restore_defaults()
```

---

## Bottom line...

**The initial plot was created for exploratory purposes**. We might generate several plots similar to this plot to explore the data. 

**The last plot was created for confirmatory purposes**. We begin with an exploratory plot and refine it with more code. Use it for a final report, class presentation, paper, final submission of HW2 for this course, etc.

# EDA with the `scorecard` dataset

The Department of Education collects annual statistics on colleges and universities in the United States. We are going to look at a subset of this data, from 2018-19.

---

## `scorecard`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rcis)
data("scorecard")
glimpse(scorecard)
```

---

## Types of visualizations we can perform

#### VARIATION or how values within a single variable vary (univariate analysis)
  
1. One continuous variable: **histogram**
2. One categorical variable: **bar chart**

#### COVARIATION or how values of two variables co-vary (bivariate analysis)

1. Two continuous variables: **scatter plot**
2. Two categorical variables: **bar chart**; pie chart; dot plot; mosaic plot
3. One categorical and one continuous variable: **box plot**; **faceted histogram**
4. One categorical and two continuous variables (multivariate analysis): **faceted scatterplot**

--

*We are going review all plots in bold today, both code and interpretation. The plots listed in this slide are the most common options, but there are more possibilities to explore.* 

*Takeaways: experiment and match the type of plot with the variable types!*

---

class: inverse, middle

## VARIATION or univariate analysis

We talk about (code and interpretation) using two examples: 

1. One continuous variable: **histogram**
2. One categorical variable: **bar chart**

<!-- ask what is the difference between the two; draw each on the board -->

---

### 1. One continuous variable: **histogram**

TASK: Use the `scorecard` data to show the annual total school attendance cost in the U.S.

For representing one continuous variable (here `cost`): the best graph is usually an histogram

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r histogram, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = cost)
  ) +
  geom_histogram()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram", title = "### 1. One continuous variable: **histogram**")`

HISTOGRAM: for **continuous variables** (here `cost`). It splits the input variable into n sets of equal width and does a frequency count within each set.

--

*Interpretation: What does this histogram tell us? Distribution? Picks?* 
*Code: What are some alternative ways to rewrite this code (using what we know) to get the same plot?*

<!-- see the file called "histogra,_otherway_tocode.Rmd" and do this in class or put it back in slides -->

---

```{r histogram-bins, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = cost)
) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) + #ROTATE
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + #ROTATE
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) #ROTATE
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram-bins", break_type = "rotate", title = "### Bins in histograms")`

Bins: each bar is a bin and represents one interval or set of data. In these examples, we divided the data into 50, 30 (default), or 10 `bins` of equally sized bars. 

Instead than `bins` you can also use `binwidth`, which changes the width of each bin vs. their number (see [here](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-binwidth-ggplot2/))

---

### 2. One categorical variable: **bar chart**

TASK: Use the `scorecard` data to show the schools in the U.S. by school type

For representing one categorical variable (here `type`): the best graph is usually a bar chart.

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r barplot, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "barplot",  title = "### 2. One categorical variable: bar chart")`

BAR CHART: for **categorical variables** (here `type`). It takes each category of the variable (here `"Public"`, `"Private nonprofit"`, `"Private for profit"`) and automatically applies a frequency count to aggregate the data by these categories. 

--

*Like we did for the histogram, let's focus on both interpretation and code: What does this graph show? How was the y-axis computed?*

<!-- we have already seen how a code similar to this, the previous one, can be rewritten. So let's focus on something new about code: the default statistics for bar chart and why this matter --> 

---

### Bar chart and its default stats

The default statistic for `geom_bar()` is `count`, not `identity` ([documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html)).

This means two things:
* `geom_bar()` automatically counts the number of occurrences for each category on the x variable
* and, when using `stat = "count"`, you do not need to provide a y variable: `geom_bar()` calculates the counts for you and displays them on the y axis

---

### Bar chart and its default stats

In practice, under the hood `geom_bar()` does the equivalent of the following `dplyr` code:

```{r}
scorecard %>%
  count(type)
```

--

We can explicitly instruct `geom_bar()` not to perform the count, by setting `geom_bar(stats = "identity")`. In this case, we need to explicitly provide a y variable with the frequency count (e.g., the `n` column in the example above).

*But why would we want to do this?  For example, to reorder the bars!*

---

### Reorder bar chart levels

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Not Ordered]


```{r not-ordered, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Ordered]

```{r reordered, echo = FALSE}
count_type <- scorecard %>% 
  count(type)

ggplot(count_type,
       mapping = aes(x = reorder(type, desc(n)), 
                     y = n)) +
       geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

]
]

---

### Reorder bar chart levels (base approach)

Reorder the levels of a categorical variable with `dplyr` and `ggplot` combined:


```
# calculate count for variable of interest and save in new dataframe
count_type <- scorecard %>%
  count(type)

# use the new dataframe to create the graph
ggplot(count_type,
       mapping = aes(x = reorder(type, desc(n)), 
                     y = n)) +
       geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

--

```
# alternative equivalent code
scorecard %>%
  count(type) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(type, desc(n)), 
                       y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```


---

### Reorder bar chart levels (other approaches)

[`fct_relevel()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html): allows to reorder factor levels by hand

```
scorecard %>%
  mutate(
  type = fct_relevel(.f = type, 
                    levels = "Private, nonprofit", "Public", "Private, for-profit" )) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type)) +
    geom_bar()
```

[`fct_infreq()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_inorder.html): reorders factor levels by the number of obs. with each level (frequency)

```
scorecard %>%
  mutate(type = fct_infreq(type)) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## COVARIATION or bivariate analysis

We talk about the following examples (in bold):

1. Two continuous variables: **scatter plot**
2. Two categorical variables: **bar chart**; pie chart; dot plot; mosaic plot
3. One categorical and one continuous variable: **box plot**; **faceted histogram**
4. One categorical and two continuous variables (multivariate analysis): **faceted scatterplot**

---

### 1. Two continuous variables: **scatter plot**

TASK: Show the annual total cost and net cost of attendance to schools in the U.S. 

For representing two continuous variables (here `cost` and `netcost`): the best graph is usually a scatter plot.

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r scatterplot, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cost,
    y = netcost
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "scatterplot", title = "### 1. Two continuous variables: **scatter plot**")`

SCATTERPLOT: looks at the relationship between two **continuous variables** (here `cost` and `netcost`). Each point represents an observation. The position of a point on the x-axis corresponds to one variable, while the position on y-axis corresponds to the other variable.

--

*What does this scatter plot tell us? What about the points not clearly aligned? What further EDA could we perform starting from this plot?*

<!--

As the advertised price increases, the net cost also increases though with significant variations. Some schools have a much lower net cost than their advertised price.

No clear alignment on diagonal, net costs tend to be lower than advertised costs for several schools, especially as the adv costs increase; in most universities the average student pay less than the adv costs. Notice this is a 2d plot bcs we are mapping two variables: one on the y and one on the x.

Link to next slide: for histogram does not make sense to map a second variable on the y, beside count/frequency bcs with a histogram see the total distribution (vs box plot in which you see summary stats of the distribution). 
-->

---

### 2. Two categorical variables: **bar chart**

TASK: Show the total number of schools in the U.S. by school type (n = 3) and by state (n = 54)

For representing two categorical variables (here `type` and `state` ) the most appropriate graph is usually a (stacked) bar chart.

---

```{r barplot_cat, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = type,
    fill = state,
  )
) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack")
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "barplot_cat", title = "### 2. Two categorical variables: **bar chart**")`

STACKED BAR CHART: Each bar represents one category of a categorical variable, and is divided into segments representing the categories of the other categorical variable.

*But... is this a good graph? Why or why not? How can we improve it? Is the issue with the graph type or the data?*

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc.  why not y? it is a bar chart (y is the frequency count of categories of x) -->

---

### 3. (a) One categorical and one continuous: **box plot**

TASK: Show the total annual cost of attendance by school type (n = 3).

For representing one continuous variable (here `cost`) and a one categorical variable (here `type`), the best graph is a usually a box plot.

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r boxplot, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = type,
    y = cost
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "boxplot", title = "### 3. (a) One categorical and one continuous: **box plot**")`

BOX PLOT: looks at the relationship between a continuous variable (here `cost`) and a  categorical variable (here `type`). It summarizes the continuous variable distribution across each of the categorical variables.

--

*What does this box plot tell us? How do we read a box plot?*

<!-- median is the line in the middle, the middle value 
Here we see that on average, public universities are the least expensive, followed by private for-profit institutions. I was somewhat surprised by this since for-profit institutions by definition seek to generate a profit, so wouldn't they be the most expensive? But perhaps this makes sense, because they have to attract students so need to offer a better financial value than competing nonprofit or public institutions. Is there a better explanation for these differences? Another question you could explore after viewing this visualization.
-->

---

### Box plot

```{r echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/153b9af53b33918353fda9b691ded68cd7f62f51/5b616/images/eda-boxplot.png")
```

---

### 3. (b) One categorical and one continuous: **faceted histogram**

TASK: Show the total annual cost of attendance by school type (n = 3)

Other than using a box plot, we can represent this same task using a faceted histogram, which creates multiple windows: one for each level of the categorical variable.

---

```{r histogram-facet, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = cost)
) +
  geom_histogram() + #BREAK
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(type)) #BREAK
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram-facet", break_type = "user", title = "### 3. (b) One categorical and one continuous: **faceted histogram**")`

FACETED HISTOGRAM: looks at the distribution of a continuous variable (here `cost`) across different levels of the categorical variable (here `type`). The y-axis shows frequency count for each level of the categorical variable. Histograms cannot map a second variable directly, but we can use facets to compare the distribution of each college type. 

*Compare this with box plot. Which one do you prefer and why?*

---

### 4. Three variables: **faceted scatterplot** 

TASK: Show the total annual cost of attendance and the net cost of attendance, by school type (n = 3).

This last example shows how to plot three variables at the same time on the same graph, using a faceted scatterplot. 

---

```{r scatterplot-facet, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cost,
    y = netcost
  )
) +
  geom_point() + #BREAK
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(type)) #BREAK
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "scatterplot-facet", break_type = "user", title = "### 4. Three variables: **faceted scatterplot**")`

SCATTERPLOT WITH FACETS: looks at two  continuous variables (here `cost` and `netcost`) for several levels of a categorical variable (here `types` of school), and plots each in a separate panel with the same scale range on the x and y.

---

```{r scatterplot-mult-channels, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cost,
    y = netcost,
    color = type, #ROTATE
    color = type, size = debt #ROTATE
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "scatterplot-mult-channels", break_type = "rotate", font_size_code = "60%", title = "### Utilizing additional aesthetics")`

Rather than using facets (for school type), we could use the color aesthetic to incorporate the `type` info into the same visualization. We can even add a fourth variable such as `depth` and render it through the `size` aesthetic. *BUT does this make the graph more informative?* Not really... Visualizations need to be clear and aesthetically pleasing, here it would be better to split the plot into two separate ones!

<!-- for in-class activity add task with this scorecard data that requires examining two categorical var and one continious one: grouped bar plot, heatmap, facet grid --> 

---

### Other types of graphs

Today we examined the most common graph options, but there are many other options you can experiment with.

See the Visualization cheat sheet:

* Note there are several **cheat sheets** for tidyverse and R: https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/

# Factors

Brief introduction to factors (since we talked about categorical variables). We will come back to factors later in the course.

Takeaway: **Categorical variables**, also called discrete variables are variables with a fixed set of possible values. R uses **factors** to work with these variables.

Chapter 16 of "R for Data Science" (2nd Ed.) explains how to create and work with factors: 

```{r create-string, eval = FALSE}
month_string <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)
month_string
class(month_string)   # character
```

```{r turn-into-factor, eval = FALSE}
month_factor <- factor(month_string, levels = month_string)
month_factor
class(month_factor)   # factor
```

Notice `class` is the attribute of the object (VS `typeof`: R internal storage of the object).

class: inverse, middle
