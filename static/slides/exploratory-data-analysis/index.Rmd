# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

### Definition of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

All set of **INITIAL** investigations to understand your data and generate questions, before running more complex analyses (e.g., modeling). Goals: 

+ discover patterns 
+ spot anomalies (outliers)
+ generate and refine questions 
+ check initial hypotheses before formally testing them

**Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA** is different from **Explanatory or Confirmatory Data Analysis**

---

### EDA is an iterative and creative process

Our book, "R for Data Science," defines EDA as an **ITERATIVE process**:

1. Generate exploratory questions about your data
1. Search for answers in the data by transforming, visualizing, and modeling the data
1. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions
1. Repeat until necessary

--

EDA is a also a **CREATIVE process**: it is not an exact science. It requires knowledge of your data and time. At the most basic level, it involves answering two questions:

1. What type of variation occurs within my variable(s)?
2. What type of covariation occurs between my variables?


---

## How to perform Exploratory Data Analysis?


**EDA relies on two things:**
- *visualizations* such box plots, histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, etc. 
- *descriptive stats* such as measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median) and of dispersion (variance, standard deviation)

--

**We focus on visualizations and especially on:**
- *variation:* how values within a single variable vary (univariate analysis)
- *covariation:* how values of two variables co-vary (bivariate analysis)

--

> Visualizations are employed in both Exploratory and Confirmatory Data Analysis, but their use is different. 

<!--
In Exploratory Analysis you might generate 10, 20 or even 100 graphs, but not all of them will be useful for your research. In Confirmatory Analysis, you generate only a few graphs and each graph is well refined and will be put in your final report or research.

# Exploratory VS. Confirmatory Data Analysis

---

## Comparing Exploratory VS. Confirmatory plots

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins")

head(penguins)
```

We want build a plot of two continuous variables: penguins body mass and flipper length

---

```{r penguins-eda, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = flipper_length_mm)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "penguins-eda", break_type = "auto", title = "## Exploratory plot")`

<!-- notice in the code I put the data and mapping above, right after ggplot() because both geometries use the same data and mapping -->

--

Exploratory plot. What does this graph tell us? Pros and cons? And how can we improve it?

<!--
Pros: minimum code, easy to replicate, good for your internal use
Cons: not well refined, not good for publication or external audience
-->

---

```{r penguins-final, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = body_mass_g,
    y = flipper_length_mm)
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between body mass and\nflipper length of a penguin",
    subtitle = "Sample of 344 penguins",
    x = "Body mass (g)",
    y = "Flipper length (mm)"
  ) +
  theme_xaringan(
    title_font_size = 18,
    text_font_size = 16
  )
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "penguins-final", break_type = "auto", title = "## Confirmatory plot")`

<!-- notice here geom_point and geom_smooth also have their own arguments that work only for them; 
for example:
if I want to make the points of the scatterplot more faded I use alpha there; 
or here I wanted to use a specific method to draw the regression line vs. let R selecting it automatically, so I specify the method and I also do se = FALSE as the default is true and shows the standard error

labs() and theme_xarigan()  control the non-data elements of the plot, the first things like title, subtitles etc the other controls background colors, font size, etc.

Notice there is also a geometry that controls titles etc. and it is called geom_text()
Note the difference between `labs()` and `geom_text()` 
Book "`ggplot2`: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" https://ggplot2-book.org/annotations.html

-->

```{r include = FALSE}
# restore default colors
theme_xaringan_restore_defaults()
```

---

### Bottom line...

The initial plot was created for *exploratory purposes*. We might generate several plots similar to this plot to explore the data. 

The last plot was created for *confirmatory purposes*. We begin with an exploratory plot and refine it with more code. Use it for a final report, class presentation, paper, final submission of HW2 for this course, etc.

# EDA with the `scorecard` dataset

The Department of Education collects annual statistics on colleges and universities in the United States. We are going to look at a subset of this data, from 2018-19.

---

## `scorecard`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rcis)
data("scorecard")
glimpse(scorecard)
```

---

## Types of visualizations we can perform

#### *Variation:* how values within a single variable vary (univariate analysis)
  
* one continuous variable: **histogram plot**
* one categorical variable: **bar plot**

#### *Covariation:* how values of two variables co-vary (bivariate analysis)

* two continuous variables: **scatter plot**
* two categorical variables: **bar plot**; pie chart; dot plot; mosaic plot
* one categorical and one continuous variables: **box plot**; **scatter plot with colors** (one color for each category of the categorical variables); **faceted histogram** (one histogram for each category of the categorical variable)

<!-- in bold all plots we see today! -->
---

class: inverse, middle

# Variation: univariate analysis

* one continuous variable: **histogram plot**
* one categorical variable: **bar plot**

We review both plots and focus on code and interpretation.


---

### One continuous variable: **histogram plot**

TASK: Show the annual total cost of attendance to schools in the U.S. 

For representing one continuous variable (here `cost`): the most appropriate graph is an histogram

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r histogram, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = cost)
  ) +
  geom_histogram()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram", title = "## Histogram")`

HISTOGRAM: for **continuous variables** (here `cost`). It splits the input variable into n sets of equal width and does a frequency count within each set.

--

Before interpreting, let's focus on the code: What are some alternative ways to rewrite this code (using what we have learned so far) to get the same results?

<!-- ask students to type it in chat, comment out code below and type that in class -->

---

### Other ways to rewrite the original code 

```
# Original code (most common)
ggplot(data = scorecard, mapping = aes(x = cost)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
--
```
# Alternative 1
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = scorecard, mapping = aes(x = cost))
```
--
```
# Alternative 2
ggplot(data = scorecard) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = cost))
```
--
```
# Alternative 3 using `ggplot2` and `dplyr`
scorecard %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cost)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

### Bins in histograms

```{r histogram-bins, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = cost)
) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) + #ROTATE
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + #ROTATE
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)   #ROTATE
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram-bins", break_type = "rotate")`

Bins: each bar is a bin and represents one interval or set of data. In these examples, we divided the data into 50, 30 (default), or 10 `bins` or equally sized bars. 

Instead than `bins` you can also use `binwidth` (see [here](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-binwidth-ggplot2/))

---

### Histogram interpretation

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = cost)
  ) +
  geom_histogram()
```

What does this histogram tell us?
Why do we have these different picks? 
Are there outliers?

---

### One continuous variable: **histogram plot**

TASK: Show the total number of schools in the U.S. by school type

For representing one categorical variable (here `type`): the most appropriate graph is a bar chart.

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r barplot, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "barplot",  title = "## Bar chart")`

BAR CHART: for **categorical variables** (here `type`). It takes each category of the variable (here `"Public"`, `"Private nonprofit"`, `"Private for profit"`) and automatically applies a frequency count to aggregate the data by these categories. 

--

Like we did for the histogram, let's focus on the code first, then move to the interpretation.

<!-- we have already seen how a code similar to this, the previous one, can be rewritten. So let's focus on something new: the default statistics for bar chart and why this matter --> 

---

### Bar chart and its default stats

```{r barplot2, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type)
) +
  geom_bar()  # geom_bar(stat = "count")
```

The default stats for `geom_bar()` is not `stat = identity` but it is `stat = count`

See [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html).

---

### Rewrite the code 

This means that `geom_bar()` automatically counts the number of occurrences for each category on the x variable. That's why, when using `stat = "count"`, you do not need to provide a y variable: `geom_bar()` calculates the counts for you.

In practice, under the hood `geom_bar()` performs the equivalent of the following (look at the output, `n`):

```{r}
scorecard %>%
  count(type)
```

Unless we explicitly tell `geom_bar()` not to do so by specifying `geom_bar(stats = "identity")` but in that case we need to provide an y with the frequency count of that variable! If we do that with `count()` it will be `n`

---

### Reorder bar chart levels

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Not Ordered]


```{r not-ordered, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Ordered]

```{r reordered, echo = FALSE}
count_type <- scorecard %>% 
  count(type)

ggplot(count_type,
       mapping = aes(x = reorder(type, desc(n)), 
                     y = n)) +
       geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

]
]

---

### Reorder bar chart levels

The best approach to reorder the levels of a categorical variables is with `dplyr` and `ggplot` combined:


```
# calculate count for variable of interest and save in new dataframe
count_type <- scorecard %>%
  count(type)

# use the new dataframe to create the graph
ggplot(count_type,
       mapping = aes(x = reorder(type, desc(n)), 
                     y = n)) +
       geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

--

```
# alternative equivalent code
scorecard %>%
  count(type) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(type, desc(n)), 
                       y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```


---

### Reorder bar chart levels

[`fct_relevel()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html): allows to reorder factor levels by hand

```
scorecard %>%
  mutate(
  type = fct_relevel(.f = type, 
                    levels = "Private, nonprofit", "Public", "Private, for-profit" )) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type)) +
    geom_bar()
```

[`fct_infreq()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_inorder.html): reorders factor levels by the number of obs. with each level (e.g., by frequency)

```
scorecard %>%
  mutate(type = fct_infreq(type)) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

# Covariation: bivariate analysis

* two continuous variables: **scatter plot**
* two categorical variables: 
  * **bar plot** 
  * others: pie chart, dot plot, mosaic plot
* one categorical and one continuous variables: 
  * **box plot**
  * **scatter plot with colors** (one color for each category of the categorical variables)
  * **faceted histogram** (one histogram for each category of the categorical variable)

---

### Two continuous variables: **scatter plot**

TASK: Show the annual total cost and net cost of attendance to schools in the U.S. 

For representing two continuous variables (here `cost` and `netcost`): the most appropriate graph is a scatter plot

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r scatterplot, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = cost,
    y = netcost
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "scatterplot", title = "## Scatter plot")`

SCATTERPLOT: looks at the relationship between two **continuous variables** (here `cost` and `netcost`). 

--

What does this scatterplot tell us?

<!--

As the advertised price increases, the net cost also increases though with significant variations. Some schools have a much lower net cost than their advertised price.

No clear alignment on diagonal, net costs tend to be lower than adv costs for several schools, especially as the adv costs increase; in most universities the average student pay less than the adv costs. Notice this is a 2d plot bcs we are mapping two variables: one on the y and one on the x.

Link to next slide: for histogram does not make sense to map a second variable on the y, beside count/frequency bcs with a histogram see the total distribution (vs box plot in which you see summary stats of the distribution). 
-->

---

###  Two categorical variables: **bar plot** 

TASK: Show the total number of schools in the U.S. by school type (n = 3) and by state (n = 54)

For representing two categorical variables (here `type` and `state` ) the most appropriate graph is a stacked bar chart

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

---

```{r barplot_cat, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = type,
    fill = state, # why not y? it is a bar chart (y is the frequency count of categories of x)
  )
) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Schools by State and Type",
    x = "School Type",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "State"
  )
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "barplot_cat", title = "## Bar plot")`

STACKED BAR PLOT: Each bar represents one category of a categorical variable, and is divided into segments representing the categories of the other categorical variable.

Is this a good graph? Why yes/no? How can we improve it?

---

```{r barplot_cat_2, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = state,
    fill = type)
) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Schools by State and Type",
    x = "State",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "School Type"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5))
```

This is better, but we are not quite there yet. We need to use `dplyr` first to manipulate the data before visualizing it with `ggplot2`... we come back to this example next lecture when we talk more about `dplyr`!

<!--
For example: aggregate the 54 states using some criteria and then display them...

```{r}
# count of observations by state
scorecard %>%
  count(state)

# define categories using mutate() and case_when()
scorecard <- 
  scorecard %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    state %in% c("CT", "ME", "MA", "NH", "RI", "VT", "NJ", "NY", "PA") ~ "Northeast",
    state %in% c("IL", "IN", "IA", "KS", "MI", "MN", "MO", "NE", "ND", "OH", "SD", "WI") ~ "Midwest",
    state %in% c("AL", "AR", "DE", "FL", "GA", "KY", "LA", "MD", "MS", "NC", "OK", "SC", "TN", "TX", "VA", "WV") ~ "South",
    state %in% c("AK", "AZ", "CA", "CO", "HI", "ID", "MT", "NV", "NM", "OR", "UT", "WA", "WY") ~ "West",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# check
scorecard %>% count(region, state)

# count(), group_by(), summarize()
by_region <- 
  scorecard %>% 
  count(region, state, type) %>%
  group_by(region, type) %>% 
  summarize(total_by_region = sum(n))

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(by_region, 
       mapping = aes(x = region, 
                     y = total_by_region, 
                     fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
           position = "stack") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Schools by Region and Type",
    x = "Region",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "School Type"
  )

# NB:
# we need both x and y here because we are using pre-summarized data given by total_by_region and here y represents value directly (counts, sums, etc.); remember to also change stat to identity vs. count
```
-->

---

###  Two categorical variables: **bar plot** 

TASK: Show the total annual cost of attendance by school type (n = 3)

For representing one continuous variable (here `cost`) and a one categorical variable (here `type`), the most appropriate graph is a boxplot

<!-- code this in class, without asking students to help,  before start typing: go back to previous slide and copy code to load library, etc. -->

--- 

```{r boxplot, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = type,
    y = cost
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "boxplot", title = "## Box plot")`

BOX PLOT: looks at the relationship between a **continuous variable** (here `cost`) and a  **categorical variable** (here `type`). It summarizes the continuous variable distribution across each of the categorical variables.

--

What does this box plot tell us?

<!-- median is the line in the middle, the middle value 
Here we see that on average, public universities are the least expensive, followed by private for-profit institutions. I was somewhat surprised by this since for-profit institutions by definition seek to generate a profit, so wouldn't they be the most expensive? But perhaps this makes sense, because they have to attract students so need to offer a better financial value than competing nonprofit or public institutions. Is there a better explanation for these differences? Another question you could explore after viewing this visualization.
-->

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram-facet", break_type = "user", title = "## Multiple windows plot - faceted histogram")`

HISTOGRAM WITH FACETS: looks at the distribution of a continuous variable (here cost) for several categories (here types of school). 

On the y axis is frequency count for each categorical variable. With histograms we cannot map a second variable, but we can use facets to compare the distribution of each college type. Compare this with box plot.

Rather than using facets (for the school type), we could use the color aesthetic to automatically incorporate the `type` info into the same visualization.

We can also add a fourth variable such as `depth` and render it through the size aesthetic. But does adding `depth` make the graph more informative?

# Factors

---

Categorical variables, also called discrete variables: variables that have a fixed set of possible values. R uses **factors** to work with these variables.

[**Chapter 15 of R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) goes in-depth on creating and modifying factors: 

```{r create-string, eval = FALSE}
month_string <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)
month_string
class(month_string)   # character
```

```{r turn-into-factor, eval = FALSE}
month_factor <- factor(month_string, levels = month_string)
month_factor
class(month_factor)   # factor
```

Notice `class` is the attribute of the object (vs `typeof`: R internal storage of the object)
