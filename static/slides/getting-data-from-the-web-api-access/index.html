## Review

---

### Last time we learned two main concepts...

#### Concept 1: How computers interact on the web

1. your browser sends a request to the server that hosts the website
1. the website's server sends back a response code and content written in HTML
1. your browser translates the response content written in HTML into the website that you see

--

Web scraping happens in step 2: you write code in R that grabs the server response written in HTML, then you write more code to extract content from it!

--

#### Concept 2: What is behind a website

* a website is mainly made of HTML, CSS, JS
* HTML: the website's "skeleton", made of tags that follow a hierarchical tree-like structure 
* CSS: builds on top of HTML, makes the website pretty (uses tags as "anchors" to style the website)

---


### Practice all of this in R with the `rvest` package

* `rvest`: https://rvest.tidyverse.org/ 
* Example: scraping presidential statements

&gt; Review Monday's slides and in-class exercises

---

### Two ways to scrape data from the web

**1: Directly scraping the website**

* Every website is made of code (a mix of HTML, CSS and Javascript). 
* To collect data from a website directly, we need to learn how to interact with the website code.
* Example: anything on the web! Scraping something from Wikipedia is a common beginners project

**2: Using a web API (Application Programming Interface)**

* Interface provided by the website that allows users to collect data from that specific website. 
* To collect data from a website using an API, we need to learn how to use that API.
* Example: [OMDb API](https://omdbapi.com/), see assigned reading chapter 4

## Scraping using an API: Application Programming Interface

---

### API: terminology

  &gt; Interface provided by the website that allows users to collect data from that specific website. 

The majority of web APIs use a particular style know as **REST** or **RESTful** which stays for Representational State Transfer. 

**REST** allows to query the website database using URLs, just like you would construct an URL to view a web page.

An **URL** (Uniform Resource Location), is a string of characters that uses the **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol to send request for data. 

---

### Sending queries to an API  

The process described in the `macss` example (last lecture, [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/slides/getting-data-from-the-web-scraping/#11)) is very similar to how APIs work, with only a few changes:

* The URL that you use for sending requests (queries) to an API will have search terms and/or filtering parameters, and authentication codes specific to that API

* The response you get back from the API is not formatted as HTML, but it will likely be a raw text response

* You need R to parse that response and convert it into a format that you like (dataframe, lists, etc.) and then export it as `.csv` or `.json`

---

### API: with and without a wrapper package

When using an API in R, we might have two approaches available to us:

* Approach 1: using an API through an R package that someone has written to interact with that API. The package acts as a **wrapper for the given API**. 

* Approach 2: if no R wrapper exists, you can **directly use the API** provided by the website. In this case, the user relies on R to directly interact with the website's API.

--

Sometimes both approaches are available. Other times only approach 2 is available. Tip for beginners: scrape with an API only if an R wrapper is available AND is well done

---

### Using an API with a wrapper package

* A wrapper is a specific package written in a given language, like R, for an existing API (tailored to that API only)

* Useful because: reproducible, up-to-date (ideally), ease of access
    
* How to use: each package should come with documentation (either a pdf, or a GitHub repo, or both) that explains how to use it and the main functions defined in it. It is essential to read the documentation to understand how to use a package.

---

### Using an API with a wrapper package: examples

The class materials for today (download it from the website) include **four examples of APIs that have a wrapper package:**

* Wordbank
* GeoNames
* Census
* Manifesto Project

We will review the first two in class (work through the other two examples on your own)

---

### Using an API with a wrapper package: examples

**Wordbank database API**: `wbstats` R wrapper package
* socioeconomic indicators spanning several decades and dozens of topics
* full data available for bulk download as CSV files from their website (see HW5); but frequently you only need to obtain a handful of indicators or a subset of countries
* the `wbstats` package provides a wrapper for R for easier access to the API; it returns the results in a tidy data frame 

**GeoNames geographical database API**: `geonames` R wrapper package
* geographical information for all countries and other locations
* the `geonames` package provides a wrapper for R

---

### Using an API with a wrapper package: examples

**Census Bureau API**: `tidycensus` R wrapper package
* statistical data from the US Census Bureau
* the `tidycensus` provides a R wrapper for the US Census Bureau’s Census and five-year American Community Survey APIs

**Manifesto Project API**: `manifestoR` R wrapper package
* political party manifestos from around the world
* covers 1,000+ parties from 1945 until today in 50+ countries on five continents. 
* the `manifestoR` package provides a wrapper for R

---

### Using an API directly (without a wrapper package)

Not all APIs have a R wrapper package to help us interact with them. If such wrapper does not exist, we can always interact directly with the API (however, I do not reccomend this option for beginners project)

This usually entails more code (such as writing our own functions), but also the ability to customize our data requests. 

The class materials for today (download it from the website) includes one example of this kind: **OMDb Open Movie Database**

---

### Using APIs: register for access

**Many APIs require you to register for access.** 
* sometimes this is as quick as providing email and password, and receiving an email with your username, private API key, etc..
* other times you have to submit an application and go through a review process
* often this process is free, but some APIs require you to pay a fee (e.g., Twitter now)

Why registering for access? It allows APIs: to track which users are submitting queries and manage demand (do not submit too many queries too quickly)

If a given API requires you to register and obtain a username, password, or key to interact with it, you will have to provide this same information also in the R wrapper package for that API.

---

### Using APIs: store username and other private info

**To tell R your APIs username (and key, if necessary), you have two options**. For example, the `geonames` API requires you to register and set a username:

1. You could run the line `options(geonamesUsername = "my_user_name")` in R.

1. However, this is insecure, especially if you put your work on GitHub. You don't want to commit this line and push it to our public GitHub page. Instead, you should:
  * create a file in the same place as your `.Rproj` file. To do that, run the following command from the R console `usethis::edit_r_profile(scope = "project")`. This will create a special file called `.Rprofile` in the same directory as your `.Rproj` file (assuming you are working in an R project)
  * the file should open automatically in your RStudio script editor; otherwise open the file and add `options(geonamesUsername = "my_user_name")` to that file, replacing `my_user_name` with your Geonames username.

---

### Using APIs: store username and other private info

Important:
* Make sure your `.Rprofile` ends with a blank line
* Make sure the line `.Rprofile` is included in your `.gitignore` file, otherwise it will be posted on GitHub
* Restart RStudio after modifying `.Rprofile` in order to load any new keys into memory

## Rectangling or Simplifying lists

---

### Rectangling

Rectangling or simplifying lists: means taking a deeply nested list (often sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data set of rows and columns.

If you need to simplify nested lists for your scraping project **make sure to check today's class materials for a tutorial and examples of rectangling!**

## API or direct scraping? 

---

### Advantages and Disadvantages of using an API vs direct scraping

API pros:
* you comply with website preferences
* sometimes using the API is the only option you have (the website can make it very difficult or impossible to gather data without an API)
* if the API has a good R wrapper, it is easier than scraping directly

API cons:
* API usually requires you to register
* rate-limit
* time invested to learn how to use the API (each website has its own API)

---

### Advantages and Disadvantages of using an API vs direct scraping

Scraping pros:
* more powerful
* basic rules can be applied to any scraping project (vs API)

Scraping cons:
* inconsistent and messy
* susceptible to site changes (e.g. your code for scraping will break)

## Scraping challenges, tips, and ethics 

---

### Scraping: General tips

* Confirm that there is no R package and no API
* Make sure your code scrapes only what you want (and no additional information)
* Save and store the content of what you scrape, so to avoid scraping it again

---

### Scraping: Challenges &amp; Solutions

* **Variety:** every website is different, so every website requires a new project

* **Bad formatting**: websites should be built using "logical formatting" following a properly nested HTML structure. In practice, that's often not the case

* **Change:** the same website might change over time, so you might find that your code of a few months ago does not work anymore. The good news is that, usually, it takes only a few changes to run it again

* **Limits:** some websites set a max amount of data you can scrape at once, for example 50 pages or 2500 articles max. The solution is to break your requests into "chunks"

* **Messy:** the scraped data are usually a bit messy, and they need to be cleaned (regex is helpful here)

* **Dynamic Scraping:** this not really a challenge but something to keep in mind: many websites incorporate Javascript dynamic parts, which require advanced scraping skills

---

### Scraping: Ethics

* **Private data (not OK) VS. Public data (OK):** If there is a password, it is private data. For example, it is not OK to scrape data from an online community where only logged-in users can access posts (unless you use the API provided by the website and follow its rules). **In general: if the website has an API, use it.**

* **Check the `robots.txt`** before you scrape by adding `/robots.txt` at the end of your URL. For example, for the NYT Robot File, type: `https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt`. The star after "User-agent" means "the following is valid for all robots"; things you cannot scrape are under "Disallow". More info [here](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html)

* **Read the website’s Terms of Service (ToS):** legal rules you agree to observe in order to use a service. Violating ToS exposes you to the risk of violating CFAA or "Computer Fraud &amp; Abuse Act", which is a federal crime.

* **If you are scraping lots of data:** use `rvest` together with `polite`. The polite package ensures that you’re respecting the `robots.txt` and not hammering the site with too many requests.

* For more info on ethical issues, check the **hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn** lawsuit case.
