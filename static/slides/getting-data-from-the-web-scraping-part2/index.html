## Review

---

## Last time we talked about two main topics...

&lt;br&gt;

### 1. How computers interact on the web

1. Your browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, etc.) sends a request to the server hosting the website.
1. The website's server responds to your browser by sending content written in HTML.
1. Your browser translates the HTML content into the website you see.

--

**Web scraping happens in step 2:** 

* you write code in R that grabs the server's HTML response: this is done with the function `read_html()` in `rvest`
* then you write more code to extract content from it: there are several functions that do that in `rvest` like `html_elements()`, `html_text2_()`, etc.

---

## Last time we talked about two main topics...

&lt;br&gt;

### 2. What is behind a website

* A website is mainly made of HTML, CSS, and JS code
* The most important is the HTML: the website's "skeleton", made of tags (and their attributes) that follow a hierarchical tree-like structure 
* CSS code builds on top of HTML: it makes the website pretty by using tags as "anchors" to style the website

---

## We also learned there are two main ways to scrape

&lt;br&gt;

### 1. Directly scraping the website

* Every website is built with code, typically a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* To collect data from a website, we need to learn how to interact with this code.
* Example: in theory, anything! in practice, start simple like Wikipedia or government sites.


--

### 2. Using a web API (Application Programming Interface)

* Interface provided by the website that allows users to collect data from it.
* To collect data from a website using an API, you need to learn how to use that API.
* Example: [OMDb API](https://omdbapi.com/), see chapter 4 from today's readings.

---

## Then we practiced "direct" scraping in R with `rvest`

**`rvest`documentation:** https://rvest.tidyverse.org/ 

**Web scraping 101:** https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/rvest.html#reading-html-with-rvest

**SelectorGadget:** https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/selectorgadget.html (see also the previous lecture class materials on this!)

**List of Functions in `rvest`:** https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html
    
#### Example: scraping Presidential statements

  &gt; Review the materials from the previous lecture!

## Scraping tips, challanges, and ethics 

---

### Scraping: tips

* Make sure your code scrapes only what you want (and no additional information)
* Slow down your scraper with `Sys.sleep()`
* Save and store the content of what you scrape, so to avoid scraping it again

---

### Scraping: Challenges &amp; Solutions

* **Variety:** every website is different, so every website requires a new project

* **Bad formatting**: websites should be built using "logical formatting" following a properly nested HTML structure. In practice, that's often not the case

* **Change:** the same website might change over time, so you might find that your code of a few months ago does not work anymore. The good news is that, usually, it takes only a few changes to run it again

* **Limits:** some websites set a max amount of data you can scrape at once, for example 50 pages or 2500 articles max. The solution is to break your requests into "chunks"

* **Messy:** the scraped data are usually a bit messy, and they need to be cleaned (regex is helpful here)

* **Dynamic Scraping:** this not really a challenge but something to keep in mind: many websites incorporate Javascript dynamic parts, which require advanced scraping skills

---

### Scraping: Ethics

* **Private data (not OK) VS. Public data (OK):** If there is a password, it is private data. For example, it is not OK to scrape data from an online community where only logged-in users can access posts (unless you use the API provided by the website and follow its rules). **In general: if the website has an API, use it.**

* **Check the `robots.txt`** before you scrape by adding `/robots.txt` at the end of your URL. For example, for the NYT Robot File, type: `https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt`. The star after "User-agent" means "the following is valid for all robots"; things you cannot scrape are under "Disallow". More [here](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html)

* **Read the website’s Terms of Service (ToS):** legal rules you agree to observe in order to use a service. Violating ToS exposes you to the risk of violating CFAA or "Computer Fraud &amp; Abuse Act", which is a federal crime.

* **If you are scraping lots of data:** use `rvest` together with `polite`. The polite package ensures that you’re respecting the `robots.txt` and not hammering the site with too many requests.

## Intro to scraping using an API

Introduction to the second way of scraping: using an API!

---

### API: terminology

  &gt; Interface provided by the website that allows users to collect data from that website. 

The majority of web APIs use a particular style know as **REST** or **RESTful** which stays for "Representational State Transfer." 

**REST** allows to query the website database using URLs, just like you would construct an URL to view a web page.

An **URL** (Uniform Resource Location), is a string of characters that uses HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to send request for data. 

---

### Sending queries to an API  

The process described in the `macss` example (last lecture) is very similar to how APIs work, with only a few changes:

* The URL that you use for sending requests (queries) to an API will have two more things: search terms and/or filtering parameters, and specific references to that API

* The response you get back from the API is not formatted as HTML, but it will likely be a raw text response

* You need R to interact with the API. For example:
 * parse that response, get the data from it
 * convert them into a format that you like (dataframe, lists, etc.)
 * then export the data, usually as `.csv` or `.json`

---

### API: with and without a wrapper package

When using an API in R, there are two approaches:

**1. With an API wrapper:** 

Using an API through an R package that someone has specifically designed to interact with that API. The package acts as a wrapper for the API. You use R to interact with the wrapper.

How to use: each package should come with documentation (in the form of a pdf, GitHub repo, or both) that explains how to use it and its main functions. Reading the documentation is essential to understand how to effectively use the package.

Example: Wordbank API with `wbstats` R wrapper package which returns results in a tidy dataframe

---

### API: with and without a wrapper package

When using an API in R, there are two approaches:

**2. Without an API wrapper, aka direct API interaction**: 

If no R wrapper exists, you can directly use the API provided by the website. In this case, you use R to communicate directly with the website's API.

Example: OMDb Movies example API without a wrapper ` https://www.omdbapi.com/`


---

### API: with and without a wrapper package

Sometimes both approaches are available. Other times, only approach 2 (direct API interaction) is available. 

**Tip:** Scraping with an API, compared to direct scraping, can be a hit-or-miss experience. The keys to success are using a well-designed R wrapper if available or relying on well-documented API documentation.

 &gt; *Next lecture we examine both approaches in more detail with examples!*

## API or direct scraping? 

---

### Using an API VS. direct scraping

API pros:
* You comply with website preferences (if a website has an API, it wants you to use it)
* Sometimes using the API is the only option you have (the website may make direct scraping difficult or impossible)
* if the API has a good R wrapper, you can get data more easily than by scraping directly

API cons:
* API usually requires you to register
* rate-limit
* time invested to learn how to use the API (each website has its own API)

---

### Using an API VS. direct scraping

Scraping pros:
* can be powerful
* basic rules can be applied to any scraping project

Scraping cons:
* inconsistent and messy
* susceptible to site changes (e.g. your code for scraping will break)
