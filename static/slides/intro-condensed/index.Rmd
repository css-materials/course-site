# Agenda

* Welcome to the course
* R and R Markdown
* Git and GitHub Review

<!--
Three main topics, each 35ish minutes
We will use full two hours today, not always like that, most days we ll finish earlier

Welcome to the course: we will talk about course objectives, topics, expectations, evaluation, software setup, and do a group activity on your expectations and tips to succeed in this course, etc.

Let me start by introducing myself and the TA... then will go around and introduce each other (keep it to a few sentences, we will have more chances)

Stop sharing slides as you talk

# Welcome to the course!

---

## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to acquire **basic computational skills**.

We focus on two things: 

1. learn R 
2. learn practices for reproducible research

Expectations:

* We won't learn coding to become Computer Scientists. We learn it as a means to an end = analyze social science data!

* You won't become an R expert in five weeks. You will learn fundamental computational skills and techniques and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, you will gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your own research

---

## Course Topics

Main topics of this course:

* Git/GitHub, R Markdown
* Data Visualization
* Data Transformation 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* R Programming: Base R, Control Structures, Functions, Data Structures
* Debugging and defensive Programming
* Reproducible research
* Web-Scraping

---

## How we will do this

We will start small and progressively build more complex code

```{r hello-world, echo = TRUE}
print("Hello world!")
```

---

## How we will do this

We will have a mix of lectures, in-class exercises, and weekly homework assignments (most of your learning will happen there!)

You will encounter errors, many errors! And you will spend time debugging them. That's normal.

You won't remember the syntax, and you will spend time finding resources to help (Google, ChatGPT are OK... but the documentation and the class materials are the first places to go).

At times you will be frustrated. That's normal. Be patient with yourself

---

## Is this course a good fit for me?

See [Should I take this course?](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/whom-course-for/) under FAQ in our website

---

## Course Expectations

See [Course Expectations](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/course-obj-expectations/) under FAQ:

* Attend classes and bring a laptop

* Complete the readings

* Zoom video should be on during lectures for most of the time 

* Ask questions and collaborate
  * 15-minute rule
  * Resources: AI, Google, StackOverflow, your peers (study group!)
  * Office Hours and ED Discussion -- see [ask questions](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/course-obj-expectations/#ask-questions) 
  * See the [how to ask for help](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/asking-questions/) page 

---

## Collaboration is good *to a point*

Researchers usually collaborate with one another on projects. Developers work in teams to write programs. Learning from others and/or the internet is good...

BUT you are expected to complete your own work, understand what the code is doing, and be prepared to explain it line-by-line to someone else...

---

## Plagiarism

Examples:

DON'T copy code from your peers. DO ask a classmate to help you debug your code (*help you*, not do it for you)

DON'T copy large chunks of code from the internet. DO rewrite it and make sure you understand every line you write

DON'T ask ChatGPT to do it for you. DO use AI tools to debug your code or to show examples to help you better understand

--

In your homework, we will ask you to list the resources you consulted. For example:
  * For this homework I collaborated with student First and Last Name
  * I met with the TA (name) for question 1
  * I asked ChatGPT to help with plotting a bar chart

---

## Homework and Evaluation

See [Evaluation Guidelines](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/) under FAQ in the course website:

* Weekly assignments + Final Project
* Submission policies for missed assignments, late work, etc.
* Evaluation Philosophy and Rubric

<!--
* **Weekly programming assignments and Final Project**: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/homework/) 

* **Submission Policies** for missed assignments, late work, etc.: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/#missed-assignments-resubmission-late-work-etc)

* **Evaluation Philosophy and Rubric**: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/#evaluation-philosophy)
-->

--

**Tips**:

* do the readings before class, even if you do not understand everything
* start early to work on the homework assignments 
* assignments (starting from the 2nd) will be challenging, especially if you have never programmed before: they won't tell you exactly what to do to solve the problem
* submit code that runs 
* form a study group, and ask for help if you get stuck

---

## Software Setup

Go to our course website under [Setup](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/setup/), and follow the instructions in the provided order

Two options:

1. Use R Studio Workbench (recommended, it minimizes problems)
2. Install the software locally

If you had troubles with the setup, please stay after class to get help from us. Only students officially enrolled in the course can access Workbench (let me know if you are not officially enrolled).

Make it a priority to have everything setup and running by the end of today!

---

## Activity: get to know each other and share expectations

In [this shared document]()

* Introduce yourself (one sentence)

* Share your expectations or goals for this course

* Share strategies
    * think about the best and worst classes you have taken; write what made the course successful (or not) for you
    * strategies you plan to adopt to be successful in the course 

* Questions?

# R scripts and RMarkdown documents review

---

## Software

Let's start by opening up and describe our RWorkbench

* RStudio
* Panels
* R scripts

---

## R Scripts, R Markdown. and Markdown

**R Scripts**: code file with extension `.R`

**R Markdown**: text file with extension `.Rmd`

**Markdown**: text file with extension `.md`

* Similarities: 
  * R Scripts only support code and comments
  * R Markdown and Markdown support code, comments, and text! 
  * both use the same syntax, R Markdown is just an extension of Markdown 
* Differences: 
  * R code can be written in both, but to directly execute it (together with text) use `.Rmd `
  * An `.md` can be generated from a `.Rmd` but not the other way around

---

## R Markdown: Knitting process

R Markdown files allow to generate well-formatted documents (md, pdf, word, html, etc.) that include text, code, and output. Workbench might give an error to knit to pdf, but you can use any other extension. 

To create such documents, you “Knit” or “render” them in three ways: 

1. by clicking the “Knit” button in the script editor panel of your R Markdown file and select the desired output

1. by adding the desired output in the YAML header such as: `github_document`, `pdf_document`, `word_document`, `html_document`, etc. (notice: without $\LaTeX$ installed, the pdf won't work)

1. by using `render()`, as explained [here](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/render.html). For example, run in your console: `rmarkdown::render("my-document.Rmd", output_format: html_document`)

---

## R Markdown: Knitting process

```{r}
include_graphics(path = "rmarkdownflow.png")
```

When you knit the document:

1. R Markdown sends the .Rmd file to knitr: http://yihui.name/knitr/

1. Knitr executes all of the code chunks and creates a new plain markdown (.md) file which includes the code and its output

1. This plain markdown file is then converted by pandoc into any number of output types including html, PDF, Word document, etc.: http://pandoc.org/

---

## R Markdown: Three main components

1. A **YAML header** surrounded by `---` at the top of the file

1. Text mixed with simple text formatting using the [Markdown syntax](../hw01-edit-README.html)

1. **Chunks** of R code surrounded by ` ``` `
To insert them:
  * keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + I
  * “Insert” button icon in the editor toolbar
  * manually type the chunk delimiters ` ```{r} and ``` `

---

## R Markdown: Basic Syntax

```` 
_Italics_ and *Italics*
````
*Italics* and _Italics_

--

````
__Bold__ and **Bold**
````
**Bold** and __Bold__

--

## R Markdown: Basic Syntax

Use a backslash `\` to make special characters visible, e.g., to interpret them literally:

--

````
I want to use \* for emphasis, not for italics: \*great\*
````
I want to use \* for emphasis, not for italics: \*great\*

--

````
I do not want a list here, I want the literal number followed by a dot: 1\.
````
I do not want a list here, I want the literal number followed by a dot: 1\.




---

## R Markdown: Unordered lists

Use either `*`, `-`, or `+`, then a space, then the text:

.pull-left[

````
+ item 1
  + sub
  + sub
- item 2
  - sub
  - sub
+ item 3
  - sub
  * sub
- item 4
  * sub
  * sub
````

]
.pull-right[

+ item 1
  + sub
  + sub
- item 2
  - sub
  - sub
+ item 3
  - sub
  * sub
- item 4
  * sub
  * sub
]

---

## R Markdown: Ordered lists

Write the number 1, followed by a period or a round bracket, then a space, then the text. 
For nested lists, indent once and use `+`, `*`, or `-` followed by a space: 

.pull-left[

````
1. item 1
    + sub
        + sub sub
    + sub
1. item 2
    * sub
        * sub
1) item 3
    - sub
       + sub
````

]
.pull-right[

1. item 1
    + sub
        + sub sub
    + sub
1) item 2
    * sub
        * sub sub
    * sub
1. item 3
    - sub
        + sub sub
    
]

---

## R Markdown: Headers

Use `#` to add headers. The more `#`, the smallest the header:

.pull-left[

````
# Main title, 1st level

## Section title, 2nd level

### Subsection title, 3rd level

#### Subsection title, 4th level

Write regular-sized sentences without `#`

````

]
.pull-right[

# Main title, 1st level

## Section title, 2nd level

### Subsection title, 3rd level

#### Subsection title, 4th level

Write regular-sized sentences without `#`

]

--

NB: in R scripts or in `.Rmd` code chunks, `#` are used for comments and the number of `#` does not matter for comments (but it does for section titles!)

---

## R Markdown: links, tables, pictures

**Link**: write the linked text in brackets `[]`, followed immediately by the URL in parentheses `()`. 

````
[R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
````

**Picture**: make sure the picture is in the correct folder ), then type `![text](picture link, "title")`. The title is optional.

**Table**: use `-----` for rows and `|` for columns. See https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/

---

## R Markdown: Inline code

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
output: html_document
---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rcis)
```

---

## Gun deaths by age

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth <- gun_deaths %>% filter(age <= 65)
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

Data for this plot come from the `gun_deaths` dataset. We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns.
Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below.

# Advanced R Markdown 

---

## R Markdown: Naming code chuncks 

A named code chunck:
````{verbatim, lang = 'markdown', echo = TRUE}
```{r youth-dist2}
# code goes here
```


Advantages:

1. More easily navigate to specific chunks (using the drop-down code navigator in the bottom-left of the script editor). Notice: Two code chunks should not have the same name.

1. Graphics produced by the chunks will have useful names

1. Used with `cache = TRUE`, allows to set up cached chunks to avoid re-performing expensive computations on every run 

--

`cache = TRUE` saves the output of the chunk to a file on memory. On subsequent runs, R will check if the code chunck has changed; if not, R reuses it rather than re-running (see Ch. 27 R for Data Science, 1st ed.)

---

## R Markdown: Code chunks options

**`eval = FALSE`** code is not evaluated; code appears in the report, results do not appear in the report (useful to show an example code in your report, or when code has an error you want to show). Default is `eval = TRUE` 

**`include = FALSE`** code is evaluated; code does not appear in the report, nor do results (useful when you do not want to clutter your report with too much code). Default is `include = TRUE`

**`echo = FALSE`** codes is evaluated; code does not appear in the report, results appear in the report (useful to show your output to people that are not interested in the code that produced it, or for demos of hw2 and hw3 which had the graphs but not code). Default is `echo = TRUE`

**`error = TRUE`** code is evaluated and appear in the report even if there is an error (e.g. to knit with errors). Default is `error = FALSE`

**`message = FALSE`** or **`warning = FALSE`** prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the  report. Defaults is `message = TRUE` or `warning = TRUE`

---

## R Markdown: Code chuncks options

```{r}
include_graphics(path = "chunk_options.jpg")
```

Source: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#chunk-options

Full list: http://yihui.name/knitr/options/

---

## Global options

Use global options if you want to change the default chunck options for all chunks in your file. 

In a code chunck (usually at the top of the document) type `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` with your options. For example, if we want to hide the code by default:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE
)
```

---

## YAML header specifications

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
author: "Sabrina Nardin"
output: html_document
---
````

* **Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage
* Standardized format for storing hierarchical data in a human-readable syntax
* Defines how your `.Rmd` file is rendered

See Chapter 27 of R for Data Science for more on YAML header (e.g., parameters, bibliogrpahies and citations). Here we review some topics not mentioned in that Chapter.

---

## YAML header specifications

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
author: "Sabrina Nardin"
output: html_document
---
````

---

## YAML header specifications: Table of contents

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
author: "Sabrina Nardin"
output: 
  html_document
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
````

---

## YAML header specifications: Apparence and Style

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
author: "Sabrina Nardin"
output: 
  html_document
    theme: readable
    fig_width: 8
    fig_height: 6
---
````


---

## YAML header specifications: Date as string

We can add a date and modify it every time we modify our file. We can add a date as a simple string:

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
output: html_document
date: "November 7, 2022"
---
````

--

But adding the date manually is not scalable. We ca add it automatically instead. 

---

## YAML header specifications: `lubridate` 

Add the date automatically using `lubridate`:

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
output: html_document
date: "`r lubridate::today()`"
---
````

For more on the `lubridate` package: Chapter 16 of R for Data Science
---

## YAML header specifications: `Sys.Date`

Add the date automatically using `Sys.Date`:

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
output: html_document
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
---
````

`Sys.Date` returns the current day in the current time zone. The default uses the format year/month/day.

---

## YAML header specifications: `Sys.time`

Add the date automatically using `Sys.time`:

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Gun deaths"
output: html_document
date: "`r format (Sys.time(), '%d, %B, %Y')`"
---
````

`Sys.time` returns an absolute date-time value which can be converted to various time zones, and it more easily is customizable.

This format says we want the date as: numeric day, full name of the month, and full (4-digit) year, but it can be changed

## Git and GitHub review

---

## Motivation 

**What are the advantages of learning to program and of using version control to keep track to our proresses VS. using a GUI software, and save different versions of our files?**

---

## Two different approaches

**TASK**: Write a report analyzing the relationship between ice cream consumption and crime rates in New York City.

**APPROACH**: Read how Jane and Sally approach this task [in our website](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/notes/intro-to-course/#benefits-to-programming-vs-gui-software) (5 min readings start from "Benefits to programming vs. GUI software")

--

.pull-left[

### Jane: a GUI workflow

1. Searches for data files online
1. Cleans the files in Excel
1. Analyzes the data in Stata
1. Writes her report in Google Docs

]

--

.pull-right[

### Sally: a programmatic workflow

1. Creates a folder specifically for this project
    * `data`
    * `graphics`
    * `output`
1. Searches for data files online
1. Cleans the files in R
1. Analyzes the files in R
1. Writes her report in R Markdown

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "70%", out.width = "70%", fig.width = 5}
include_graphics(path = "https://i.imgflip.com/1szkun.jpg")
```

---

## Automation


* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
    
    
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

---

## Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

---

## Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box) vs. Version Control Software
    * Repository on your computer for which the VCS tracks all changes (who, when, what, etc.). Example: Git
    * Usually implemented in conjunction with remote serves to store backups of your repository. Example: GitHub

---

## Git and GitHub

This is a short summary (see assigned readings from more in-depth explanation)

Often these two terms are used together, but they are not the same thing (see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/what-are-git-github/) for more):

* **Git:** version control system used to track changes in repositories (which are like folders in a project) over time

* **GitHub:** cloud-based hosting service that hosts and lets you manage your Git repositories (is where you store / distribute repositories)

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%"}
include_graphics(path = "https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7MQClrRp--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7ce4oq75sia6ni6q46s3.png")
```
---

## General Git workflow

Common steps to memorize:

  * Make changes locally (your machine or Workbench) to your files
  * Save your changes locally
  * Pull-Stage-Commit-Push: 
    * Pull from GitHub (this is like "refreshing" your copy of the files on your machine, especially important when you collaborate with others)
    * Stage and Commit your changes to your local Git repo
    * Push your changes online to GitHub

While 99% of the time you will use Git to add, commit, push, and pull, there are many more Git Commands. After this class you will gain enough exposure to Git to be able to quickly learn new commands and become an expert Git user.

**Stage and Commit often:** think of it as of taking a photo of everything to document where you are in your project; for example, I save, stage and commit, multiple times during a work session

**When you commit, type a meaningful message** to remind yourself (and others) what has changed in your file: keep the message short; there are several tips online if you search for "commit message best practice", we won't be picky as long as your message is informative

**Push also often, but possibly less often than you commit:** people vary on this, some push every time they commit, others wait and push several commits at once

**There are several interfaces to work with Git:** in this class we use the integrated RStudio interface; other popular options are GitHub desktop and the terminal/shell (we will learn how to use Git from the terminal toward the end of the course)

## What to commit / not to commit

**What files to commit:**

* Source files (code, README, etc.)
* Markdown files
* Data files

**What files to not commit:**

* Temporary files
* Log files
* Files with private details
* Any file greater than 100 megabytes

`.gitignore`

* It is a system file that tells Git which files/directories to ignore
* Examples of gitignore files [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore): look for the gitignore file for R (standard file that will take care of most of your needs)
* For more info to create a .gitignore file see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_ignore.asp?remote=github)

## Git Large File Storage

What if I have a large file I want to track with Git?

* See [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* This is a separate software for tracking large files
* Integrates with Git
* Generally charges a fee

## Git and merge conflicts

Typically these occur when you haven't pulled before pushing changes in a collaborative project. 

If you work alone on a given repo this is less relevant, unless you modify a file directly from GitHub (which is not a good practice!).

When you have a merge conflict there are two 'current' versions of a file and they need to be reconciled: 
* sometimes they can be automatically resolved
* sometimes you have to solve them manually (review the code side-by-side and confirm the changes)

## Avoiding (most) Git problems

1. Change your file locally, then stage and commit them (early and often)
1. Push regularly to GitHub
1. Pull before you push

To test your understanding and for further practice using Git with the integrated R Studio Git GUI, complete the ["Using Git with RStudio"](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/setup/git/git-with-rstudio/) tutorial on our course website
