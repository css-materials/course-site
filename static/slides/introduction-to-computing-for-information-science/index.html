## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to acquire and practice **basic computational skills**. We focus on: learning R and learning practices for reproducible research. 

* Programming as a means to an end: analyzing social science data

* You will learn fundamental computational skills and techniques, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your own research


---

## Major Topics

Major topics:

* Basic R, Git/GitHub, R Markdown
* Data Visualization and Data Transformation 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Wrangling
* R Programming: Control Structures, Functions, Data Structures
* Debugging and defensive Programming
* Reproducible research
* Scraping
* Text-Analysis


---

## How we will do this

We will start small and progressively build more complex code



```r
print("Hello world!")
```

```
## [1] "Hello world!"
```

## General Expectations

See [Course Expectations](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/course-obj-expectations/) under FAQ:

* Attend classes and bring a laptop

* Complete the readings

* Please no abuse of emails, texts, social media, etc. during lectures 

* Ask questions and collaborate (without plagiarize)
  * 15-minute rule
  * Important resources: Google, StackOverflow, your peers (study group!)
  * Office Hours and ED Discussion -- see [ask questions](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/course-obj-expectations/#ask-questions) 
  * See the [how to ask for help](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/asking-questions/) page 

---

## Plagiarism

### Collaboration is good - *to a point*

Researchers usually collaborate with one another on projects. Developers work in teams to write programs. Learning from others and/or the internet is good **BUT** you are expected to complete your own work, understand what the code is doing and be prepared to explain it in details to someone else.

* Never blindly copy from your peers 
* Do not copy large chunks of code from the internet (but using it to debug programs is OK)
* Asking a classmate to help you debug your program is fine (*help you*, not do it for you)

In your homework, at the top please mention the resources you had access to complete it. For example:
  * For this homework I collaborated with student First and Last Name
  * I met with the TA (name) for question 1
  * I consulted Stack overflow to solve part of question 2
  * etc.

---

## Homework and Evaluation

See [Evaluation Guidelines](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/) under FAQ

* **Weekly programming assignments**: seven in total, see the [Homework](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/homework/) on the course webpage

* **Submission Policies** for missed assignments, re-submission, late work, etc. (see website)

* **Evaluation Philosophy and Rubric**: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/#evaluation-philosophy)

* Further tips and expectations:
  * start early to work on the homework assignments 
  * assignments (starting from the 2nd) will be challenging, especially if you have never programmed before
  * they won't tell you exactly what to do or to solve the problem
  * submit code that runs 
  * form a study group, and ask for help if you get stuck
---

## Software Setup

Go to our course website under [Setup](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/setup/), and follow the instructions in the provided order

Two options:

* Option 1 use R Studio Workbench (recommended! main reason: minimizes frustrations)

* Option 2 install the software locally

If you had troubles with the setup, please stay after class to get help from the TAs. Only students officially enrolled in the course can access Workbench (approach me after class/email me if you are not officially enrolled).

Make it a priority to have everything setup and running by the end of the week!

# Group chat

---

# In groups of 3-4 people

* Introduce yourself

* Share your expectations/goals for this course

* Share strategies
    * think about the best and worst classes you have taken in this field or related fields; describe what made the course successful (or not) for you
    * strategies you plan to adopt to be successful in the course 

* Explore the website

* Questions?

# Programming and reproducible workflow

See [Introduction to the course notes](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/notes/intro-to-course/) in our website

---

## Program

&gt; A series of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation

* Input (usually data)
* Output (what you want to produce)
* How you get from Input to Output:
  * Math
  * Logic (e.g. conditional execution)
  * Repetitions

Virtually all programs are built using these fundamental components.

Stata is for the most part a GUI software. 

A GUI software runs using all the basic programming elements, but the end user is not aware of any of this. Instructions in GUI software are implicit to the user, whereas programming requires the user to make instructions explicit.

**What are the advantages of learning to program VS. using a GUI software, such as Stata?**

---

## Two different approaches

**TASK**: Write a report analyzing the relationship between ice cream consumption and crime rates in New York City.

**APPROACH**: Read how Jane and Sally approach this task [in our website](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/notes/intro-to-course/#benefits-to-programming-vs-gui-software) (5 min readings start from "Benefits to programming vs. GUI software")

.pull-left[

### Jane: a GUI workflow

1. Searches for data files online
1. Cleans the files in Excel
1. Analyzes the data in Stata
1. Writes her report in Google Docs

]

.pull-right[

### Sally: a programmatic workflow

1. Creates a folder specifically for this project
    * `data`
    * `graphics`
    * `output`
1. Searches for data files online
1. Cleans the files in R
1. Analyzes the files in R
1. Writes her report in R Markdown

---

## Automation


* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
    
    
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

---

## Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

---

## Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box) vs. Version Control Software
    * Repository on your computer for which the VCS tracks all changes (who, when, what, etc.). Example: Git
    * Usually implemented in conjunction with remote serves to store backups of your repository. Example: GitHub

---

## Documentation

* *Comments* are the what
* *Code* is the how
* Computer code should also be *self-documenting*
* Future-proofing

---

## Badly documented code


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)
tml1 &lt;- get_timeline("MeCookieMonster", 3000)
tml2 &lt;- get_timeline("Grover", 3000)
tml3 &lt;- get_timeline("elmo", 3000)
tml4 &lt;- get_timeline("CountVonCount", 3000)
ts_plot(group_by(bind_rows(select(tml1, created_at), select(tml2, created_at), select(tml3, created_at), select(tml4, created_at), .id = "screen_name"), screen_name), by = "months")
```


* What does this program do?
* What do the variable names mean? 
* What does 3000 refer to?
* What are we doing with the `ts_plot()` function?


---

## Good code



.tiny[

```r
# get_to_sesame_street.R
# Program to retrieve recent tweets from Sesame Street characters

# load packages for data management and Twitter API
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)

# retrieve most recent 3000 tweets of best Sesame Street residents
cookie &lt;- get_timeline(
  user = "MeCookieMonster",
  n = 3000
)

grover &lt;- get_timeline(
  user = "Grover",
  n = 3000
)

elmo &lt;- get_timeline(
  user = "elmo",
  n = 3000
)

count_von_count &lt;- get_timeline(
  user = "CountVonCount",
  n = 3000
)

# combine, group by character, and plot weekly tweet frequency
bind_rows(
  `Cookie Monster` = cookie %&gt;% select(created_at),
  Grover = grover %&gt;% select(created_at),
  Elmo = elmo %&gt;% select(created_at),
  `Count von Count` = count_von_count %&gt;% select(created_at),
  .id = "screen_name"
) %&gt;%
  group_by(screen_name) %&gt;%
  ts_plot(by = "months")
```
