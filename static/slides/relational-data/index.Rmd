# Relational data

### Definition of relational data

**Relational database**: set of multiple "tables" that are linked based on data common to them. You can think of a "table" as a dataframe.

These tables provide meaningful insights only when combined together = answers to research questions are not defined by individual rows or columns in a single table; rather, they emerge from the relationships among tables.

<!--
why you want to do so? e.g. store data in different tables?

Data you need for the analysis is not and cannot be stored in one single table
but it is split across tables; usually two but potentially more
-->

---

### Our focus today

There are several software and languages to deal with relational databases, the most common is SQL. 

R has a package `dbplyr` that supports SQL code, but that's beyond our course. For more on this, I recommend ["Chapter 21 Databases"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/databases) from our book.

**R also allows you to join tables without using SQL, by simply using the `dplyr` package. That's our focus today!**

<!-- dplyr for relational data focuses on joining tables; it is basically merging data and no really needing sql terminology and concepts (e.g., table, attributes, relations) but there is value in using them, as explained in the assigned readings from today, which is Ch 19 joins from the book

So we do a mini theoretical intro to relational databases logic and terminology and then we move to dplyr
-->

---

### Example

`library(nycflights13)` in ["Chapter 19 Joins"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins) from "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition. 

Five tables: 
* `flights` flights info
* `airlines` info about the full name of airplane company, identified the career abbreviated code
* `airports` info about each airport, identified by the faa airport code
* `planes` info about each plane, identified by its tailnum
* `weather` info about the weather at each NYC airport for each hour

---

### Example

Graphical representation of the relations among the tables in `nycflights13`:

```{r out.width="60%"}
include_graphics(path = "relational-nycflights.png")
```

To understand diagrams like this, remember that each relation always concerns a **pair of tables**. Even if you have several tables in your relational database, relations are defined between a pair.

---

### Formal definitions 


A **KEY** of a table is a subset of columns (also called attributes in SQL terminology). Two types of keys:

* **PRIMARY KEY**
uniquely identifies an observation in its own table; e.g., `tailnum` is the primary key of the `planes` table

* **FOREIGN KEY**
matches the primary key of another table; e.g., `tailnum` is a foreign key in the `flights` table (it appears in the flights table, where it matches each flight to a unique plane)


```{r out.width="40%"}
include_graphics(path = "relational-nycflights.png")
```

<!--
A variable can be both a primary key and a foreign key. For example, origin is part of the weather primary key, and is also a foreign key for the airports table. 
-->

--

A **RELATION** is defined between **pairs of tables**: primary key + foreign key in another table.

<!--
Relations can be
* one-to-one
* one-to-many: each flight has one plane, but each plane has many flights
* many-to-many
-->

#  In pratice...  `dplyr` for relational data!

* **Mutating joins**: inner join, out joins (left, right, full)

* **Filtering joins**: semi join, anti join 

---

## Mutating joins

**inner join**: keeps observations that appear in both tables

**outer join**: keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables
  * **left join**: keeps all observations in left table
  * **right join**: keeps all observations in right table
  * **full join**: keeps all observations

---

### inner_join()

Keeps observations that appear in both tables (identified by keys, the colored numbers here). Unmatched rows are not included in the results.

.pull-left[


```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-setup.png")
```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="110%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-inner.png")
```

```
inner_join(x, y, by = "key")

# with pipes
x %>% inner_join(y, by = "key")
  
# if two cols do not have same name
inner_join(x, y, by = c("a" = "b")) 
  
```

]

<!-- by convention, x is assigned as the first dataframe or left one, and y as the second or right one; 

the by argument specifies that we are joining it based on the key column (which you cannot see from the slide but its the column name of the colored columns in each x and y). Compare this to the left_join() operation which is another form of mutating join
-->

---

### left_join()

Keeps all observations in the left table (x), even if there is not a match in the right table (y).

.pull-left[

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-setup.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-outer-left.png")
```

```
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

] 

---

### right_join()

Keeps all observations in the right table (y), even if there is not a match in the left table (x).

.pull-left[

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-setup.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-outer-right.png")
```

```
right_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

] 

<!-- same thing as left join but reversing the order of the data frame or table
typically right join is utilized less because by convention we think at the left or x table as the primary  data for these kind of operations 
-->

---

### full_join()

Keeps all observations, matches and non-matches

<!-- more missing values -->

.pull-left[

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-setup.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-outer-full.png")
```

```
full_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

] 

---

### Mutating join venn diagram 

```{r out.width="60%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-venn.png")
```

---

## Filtering joins

Other than mutating joins, `dplyr` has filtering joins;

- **semi_join**: keeps all observations in x that have a match in y
- **anti_join** drops all observations in x that have a match in y

Essentially these function use information from the second data frame (y) to filter observations from the first data frame (x).

---

### semi_join()

Keeps all observations in x that have a match in y. Only keeps columns from the first table you pass in the code (x).

.pull-left[

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-setup.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-semi.png")
```

```
semi_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

] 


---

### anti_join()

Drops all observations in x that have a match in y. Only keeps columns from the first table you pass in the code (x).

.pull-left[

```{r out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-setup.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics(path = "join-anti.png")
```

```
anti_join(x, y, by = "key")
```
]
