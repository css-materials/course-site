# Save code, not workspace

---

### Workspace

When you are running a session of R, the workspace contains all the objects you created in that session: 
* Libraries with `library()`
* User-created objects (variables, functions, etc.)

Our goal: not to preserve the workspace, but the code that produces that workspace

---

### Code = Pet, Workspace = Cattle

```{r fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "/img/individual-cows-vs-cattle.png", error = FALSE)
```

<!-- https://blog.octo.com/en/pet-vs-cattle-from-server-craftsman-to-software-craftsman/ -->

--

**Think of your R workspaces as livestock, not pets. Your R code is your pet!**

---

### Why saving code and not workspace?

Advantages of saving your code using script or Rmd (vs. saving workspace)... 

--

more reproducibility and less mistakes!

---

### Why saving code and not workspace?

Advantages of saving your code using script or Rmd (vs. saving workspace)... 


* **ensures reproducibility** (for others and yourself): if everything is in the code, other people can reproduce your work and you can re-run the code and recreate the workspace

* **reduces chances of mistakes**: if you save the workspace, next time you open R you won't remember how you created all objects that are saved in your workspace...
  * you might have objects that have been generated by other scripts 
  * you might have loaded something that you do not even remember
  * you might have modified objects and not save the code

---

### Three ways to improve your workflow

1. **save all important code** in your R script or Rmd

1. start R with an **empty new workspace**, do not restore the previous section 

1. restart R often using **Session > Restart R**


---

### Start with a **new workspace**, do not restore previous section  

R by default will prompt you to save your workspace by asking "do you want to store your workspace?" if you save it, the next time you open up R, it will reopen the saved workspace 

Instead, change the default settings:
  
  * "Do you want to save your workspace?" No, thanks
  
  * Tools > Global Options > General 
      * uncheck “Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup”
      * set to Never "Save workspace to .RData on exit"


---

### Restart R often using Session > Restart R

If you want to make sure your workspace is 100% clear, save your code and restart R without preserving the workspace

* more efficient than using `rm(list = ls())` which only deletes user-created objects and won't remove packages that you loaded separately 

* you do not need to close and open R back again: R will stay open, but all the underlying objects get cleared out and you start clean

---

### Why doing all of this?

---

### Reducing mistakes by avoiding "unknown unknowns"

Write every script like its running in a fresh process to **avoid the "unknown unknowns"** (by Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense under George W Bush)... 

typical unknowns... we loaded something in the workspace that we did not even remember, or we have run previous scripts for which results are held, we have modified variables and did not save the code, etc.

--

**Exception:** There are some instances where running everything in a new session of R might be challenging, such as **storing computationally demanding output**:
* In Rmd: `cache = TRUE`
* In regular R script: use `write_rds()` to save & `read_rds()` to import back

# Project-based Workflow

---

### Project-based Workflow

In this class, we have been using a project-based workflow **by splitting work into project**...
every homework assignment has been stored in a different R project, and every in-class practice exercise that you downloaded from the website has been stored as a R project

**Value of this approach**:
* keeps materials organized
* helps managing working directories

---

### Working directory

The folder that R takes as **default directory** every time you try to access files, scripts, etc.

To check your current working directory: start a new session of R and type `getwd()`. In R workbench it should be `"/home/your_cnetid"`

---

### Setting your working directory

You can manually set your directory to an absolute path, for example using `setwd()` but that is not the best approach for reproducibilty 

Instead you can use relative file paths (relative to the project folder where this project is stored)

--

Let's see an example...

---

### Working directory with `setwd()`

This example uses `setwd()`to manually set your working dir to a specific folder:

```r
library(tidyverse)

# get current working directory
getwd()

# modify it
setwd("/Users/Sabrina Nardin/Desktop/something_something/foofy/data")

# reference directly data to import
foofy <- read_csv("raw_foofy_data.csv")

# plot
p <- ggplot(foofy, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

# save p in figures folder, use .. notation to go up one level 
ggsave("../figures/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```
--

Is this code reproducible?

---

### Is this code reproducible?

The previous code is not reproducible because **I hard coded my own absolute path in the code**. If you try to run the same code, you will get an error. This hinders reproducibility! 

**Goal:** avoid specifying the working directory, and have it detected automatically.

---

### RStudio Projects `.Rproj`

R studio has something called "RStudio Projects" (**`.Rproj`**) to help us implement this workflow. R will automatically detect the working directory based on your project. This ensures portability and a reliable behavior!

It requires good habits such as... 

* **File system discipline**: one project = one folder with all material you need for that project
* **File path discipline**: do not use long file paths for working directories

--

For example, every homework and in-class exercise folder that we have been using in this course has a `.Rproj` file. This file helps R to automatically detect the working directory. If you switch between projects, the working directory changes automatically. 

---

### Working dir with `setwd()` vs Project-based Workflow

Let's re-do the previous example using `.Rproj`:
* Go to `File > New Project > Existing Directory`
* If I set the Existing Directory to my project `something_something` the previous code can be modified as follows:

```r
library(tidyverse)

# get current working directory 
getwd()

# reference directly the data to import
foofy <- read_csv("foofy/data/raw_foofy_data.csv")

# plot
p <- ggplot(foofy, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

# save p in figures folder
ggsave("foofy/figures/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```

## Practice using reproducibile workflow in R

---

### Instructions:

1) In your R Workbench, create a new R Project (File > New Project > New Directory)
 * no need to make it a version control project for this exercise
 * name it "test" and place it in a sub-folder (e.g., your lecture sub-folder, etc.)

2) Inside your newly created "test" folder, create a "data" sub-folder (go under "Files" and click on the yellow folder icon "New Folder")

3) In your R Workbench, you should have your HW3 with a folder called "data" and two `.csv` files. You want to take the `scdb-case.csv` and make a copy of it in your newly created "test" folder. To do so:
* navigate to the HW3 folder, find the csv file and check the box next to it
* click on the blue wheel icon under "Files" and select "Copy to"
* navigate to the "test" folder, then to its "data" sub-folder, and move the csv to that sub-folder

---

### Instructions (cont.):

4) Create a new R script inside your "test" folder (File > New File > R Script) 

5) Use `getwd()` to check your working directory. It should be your new project's working directory

6) In your R script, write code to load the tidyverse library, and write code to import into R the `scdb-case.csv` data:
* using a **full path**
* using a **relative path** (relative to your `.Rproj`)

---

### Use safe filepaths

Using R projects to encapsulate our project is great and prevents a number of problems. 

So far we have learned to:
* avoid `setwd()` at all costs
* split work into R projects
* declare each folder as a project

In addition:
* We can use `here()` to identify a file location independently from the current working directory. So, even if the working directory accidentally gets changed, we still are able to retrieve the file.

---

### How to use the `here()` function from the `here` package

```{r}
library(here)
here()
```

This prints out what it identifies as current project folder (relative to where these slides have been created)

--

I can use `here()` to build a file path based on this directory!

Example: to access a file `awesome.txt` located in a specific folder and sub-folder of `course-site`, I pass each folder and the name of the file as different arguments to the `here()` function:

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
# use here to build the path
here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")

# test to see if it works
cat(readLines(here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")))
```
    
---

### How to use the `here()` function from the `here` package

What happens if I change the working directory?

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
# change the working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Sabrina Nardin/Desktop/course-site/content")

# test to see if this still works
cat(readLines(here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")))
```

Since I changed the working directory, there is no "static" folder anymore, but the `here()` function still works!

This because the output of the code `here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")` remains the same regardless on how we change the working dir: **`here()` identifies the location of the current `.Rproj`** and builds the path from there

---

# Practice using reproducbile workflow within R

---

### Instructions:

8) Load the `here` library (already installed on R Workbench). Type `here()` to print out what the function identifies as current project folder. 

9) Import the same `scdb-case.csv` file building a path with `here()`

---

### Filepaths and R Markdown

**Every time you knit an `.Rmd` file, R always assumes that file is located is the working directory**, regardless of whatever you are doing in R. This is important to remember, and sometimes leads to complications.

Let's see an example with the supreme courts data you worked with for HW3... 

---

### Filepaths and R Markdown: Example

We have a `"court-project"` folder, structured as follows:

```
data/
  scotus.csv
analysis/
  exploratory-analysis.Rmd
final-report.Rmd
scotus.Rproj
```

--

Imagine that in both R Markdown files (`exploratory-analysis.Rmd` and `final-report.Rmd`), we have this piece of code: `read_csv("data/scotus.csv")`

* In `final-report.Rmd`, will this code work?
* In `exploratory-analysis.Rmd`, will this code work? 

* If we replace `read_csv("data/scotus.csv")` with `read_csv(here("data", "scotus.csv"))`, the code will this code work in both .Rmd files. Why?
