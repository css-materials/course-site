# Topic Modeling

---

# Topic Modeling

Method to organize and understand large collections of textual information (without reading them).

How? 

By **finding groups of words ("topics") that go together.** Words that co-occur more frequently that chance alone would predict are assigned to the same topic.

Example: organizing 1.2M books into 2000 topics see David Mimno [slides here](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/slides/details.pdf) and [video here](https://vimeo.com/53080123). 

---

# Topic Modeling

**Word Frequency** looks at the exact recurrence of each word in a corpus (using a simple count or a weighted count).

Instead: 

**Topic Modeling** looks at how groups of words co-occur together (using probability).

--

Intuition: 

The meaning of words is dependent upon the broader context in which they are used. 

---

# Topic Modeling

A topic is a set of words that are associated with one another, showing an underlying common theme that is semantically interpretable by humans. 

A topic is similar to what a human would call a theme or a discourse: whenever a specific discourse is made, some words tend to come up more frequently than others. The goal of TM is to identify the discourses that characterize a collection of documents. 

---

# Topic Modeling

One way to think about how TM…

Imagine working through an article with a set of highlighters. As you read through the article:
  * you use a different color for the key words of themes within the article as you encounter them
  * when you were done, you could take all words of the same color and create separate lists (one per each topic)

# Topic Modeling: LDA

TM is the name of a family of algorithms. The most common is **LDA or Latent Dirichlet Allocation**. This model assumes that:

1. every document in a corpus contains a mixture of topics that are found throughout the entire corpus

1. each topic is made of a (limited) mixture of characteristic words, which tend to occur together whenever the topic is displayed

The topic structure is hidden ("latent"): we can only observe the documents and words, not the topics themselves; the goal is to infer such topics by the words and documents (more formally: topic modeling computes the conditional posterior distribution of latent variables, e.g. topics, given the observed variables, e.g. words in documents).

---

# Topic Modeling: LDA

**LDA works as follows:**

1. The researcher begins by setting an arbitrary number of topics (`k`) for the whole collection of documents.

1. The algorithm (Gibbs sampling) creates, simultaneously:
    * a first randomly chosen word-topic probability: distribution of topics over all observed words in the collection
    * a first randomly chosen document-topic probability: distribution of topics by document 

1. Through reiterative attempts, the algorithm adjusts these initial distributions to provide a set of probabilities for every word-topic pair and for every document-topic pair. 

---

# Topic Modeling: LDA

**LDA produces two types of output:**

1. words most frequently associated with each of the `k` topics specified by the researcher 

1. documents most frequently associated with each of the `k` topics (the researcher defines a probabilty theresold)

---

# Topic Modeling: LDA simple example

We start with a simple example, then move to a real example in R. Imagine we have a corpus with the following five documents (each document is one sentence):

**Document 1**  I ate a banana and spinach smoothie for breakfast.

**Document 2**  I like to eat broccoli and bananas.

**Document 3**  Puppies and kittens are cute.

**Document 4**  My sister adopted a kitten yesterday.

**Document 5**  This cute hamster is eating a piece of broccoli.

---

# Topic Modeling: LDA simple example

**First, we need to transform these textual data in the appropriate form needed for LDA:**
* input:
  * raw data
* output:
  * create a vocabulary (remove stop words, lowercase, tokenize, etc.)
  * create a document-term matrix

**Then, we run LDA:**
* input:
  * the document-term matrix as input
  * the number of topics we want to generate (we decide them)
* output:
  * the word-topic and document-topic probabilities

---

# Topic Modeling: LDA simple example

If we give to LDA the document-term matrix from these 5 documents, and we ask for 2 topics, LDA might produce something like: 

**Topic A:** 30% eat, 20% broccoli, 15% bananas, 10% breakfast, …

**Topic B:** 20% dog, 20% kitten, 20% cute, 15% hamster, …

--

**Document 1 and 2** 100% Topic A (we can label it "food")

**Document 3 and 4**: 100% Topic B (we can label it "cute animals")

**Sentence 5:** 60% Topic A, 40% Topic B

# Topic Modeling: LDA example in R

Download today's class materials to access the code, we use the textbook example in Chapter 6

**Examples from the book**: Chapter 6, and the three case-study chapters + Chapter 2 to reshape the data into the appropriate format for LDA

---

# Topic modeling: pros/cons

* Topic models **account for "multiplexity":** a given document is unlikely to fall precisely and fully into a single topic 

* Topic models **do not care about the order of words** “dog eats food" is the same as "food eats dog" 

* To determine the "right" number of topics: no fixed rule, it is a try-error process, ultimately **the researcher decides** (there are some metrics, such as perplexity and coherence score but are beyond our goals)

* Topics are **unlabeled:** they are just a bunch of words, it is up to the researcher to read, interpret, and label them

* Topic models are **no substitute for human interpretation of a text:** they are a way of making educated guesses about how words cohere into different latent themes by identifying patterns in the way they co-occur within documents. Many people are somewhat disappointed when they discover their model produces uninformative results

1. What is the meaning of each topic?
1. How prevalent is each topic?
1. How do the topics relate to each other?

# Sentiment Analysis

---

# Sentiment Analysis

Use of NLP and programming to **study emotional states and subjective information in a text**. 

In practice sentiment analysis is usually applied:
* to determine the polarity of a text: whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral
* to detect specific feelings and emotions: angry, sad, happy, etc.
* examples: analyzing costumer feedback, classify movies review

Different from Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis it is usually supervised (e.g., needs a labeled input to compare our text to)

---

# Sentiment Analysis: our approach

Our approach to sentiment analysis (consistent with the book, Chapter 2): 

* consider the text a combination of its individual words, and 
* consider the sentiment content of the text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words

Notice: "This isn’t the only way to approach sentiment analysis, but it is an often-used approach, and an approach that naturally takes advantage of the tidy tool ecosystem."

---

# The `sentiments` datasets 

The tidytext package provides access to several sentiment lexicons:

+ **AFINN** from Finn Årup Nielsen (words classified with on a scale from -5 to +5)
+ **bing** from Bing Liu and collaborators (words classified into binary categories: negative and positive)
+ **nrc** from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney (words classified in multiple categories)

See: https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html#the-sentiments-datasets

---

# The `sentiments` datasets

These dictionaries constitute our gold standard (e.g., our labeled sentiments): we use them to classify our texts.

Dictionary-based methods like these find the total sentiment of a piece of text by adding up the individual sentiment scores for each word in the text.

# Sentiment Analysis: Examples

**Examples from the book**: Chapter 2, and the three case-study chapters

**Another example (in today's class-materials)**: sentiment analysis of Harry Potter textual data.
