## General workflow in four steps

Wide range of methods, but similar workflow. We can think at it as a 4-step process:

1. Obtain your textual data

1. Data pre-processing 

1. Data transformation (from words to numbers)

1. Data analysis (wide range of methods; content of previous steps depends on the data analysis)

Let's review each step...

---

### 1. Obtain your textual data

Common data sources for text analysis:

* Online (Scraping and/or APIs)
* Large collections of digitised books and documents (see [here](https://libguides.union.edu/digital-scholarship/cta) under Data)
* PDF documents
* Political speeches, party manifestos, etc.

---

### 1. Obtain your textual data

Distinguish between **corpus** and **document**!

* **Corpus**: general term that refers to a collection of texts (e.g., a set of articles from the NYT, novels by an author, one or multiple books, etc.)

* **Document**: each corpus might have individual articles, chapters, pages, or even paragraphs. Each individual unit is called a document, and you decide what defines a document in your corpus. 

---

### 2. Data pre-processing

Data pre-processing means transforming the raw data to ensure better data analysis

Standard pre-processing tasks:

* Tokenize the text (to n-grams)
* Convert to lower case
* Remove punctuation and numbers
* Remove stopwords (standard and custom/domain-specific)
* Remove or replace other unwanted tokens
* Stemming or Lemmatization 

--

Why is data pre-processing important in text mining?

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: tokenization

**Tokenize** a text means splitting it into single tokens. A token can be word(s), alphanumeric characters, !, ?,  etc.

Example: how can we tokenize the following text?

`I bought three books online, but I forgot Bob Dylan's biography. I'll e-mail the seller to add it to my order!`


---

### 2. Data pre-processing: tokenization

Tokenize using white spaces is a common first step.

BUT there are many exceptions that good tokenizers must consider. For example contractions (I'll, Bob Dylan's), hyphens in or between words (e-mail, co-operate, take-it-or-leave, etc.).

So we use packages that tokenize the text for us based on linguistic principles. 

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: tokenization

Scholars say **"n-grams tokenization"** (or "tokenize by n-grams"): because tokenization is not only done using single words as tokens, like in our example; one token can be made of single letters, two letters, or two words, etc.

--

**N-grams**: general term used in NLP to define a contiguous sequence of n-items from a text 
* n: define the quantity (one, two, three, etc.)
* grams: define the item (words, syllables, letters, etc.)

We usually keep uni-grams but often also bi-grams or three-grams are useful. For example: `Bob Dylan` VS. `Bob` and `Dylan` 

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: stopwords

**Stopwords** are words commonly used in a language, that do not provide useful information, such as articles, pronouns, and prepositions

`I bought three books online, but I forgot Bob Dylan's biography. I'll e-mail the seller to add it to my order!`

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: stopwords

To prepare the text for analyses, remove stopwords (standard and custom/domain-specific):

* Standard stopwords: the, is, are, a, in, to, but, etc.

* Custom stopwords: if you are working on a corpus that talks about "President Biden" you might want to add "Biden" among your stop words

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: stemmatization and lemmatization

**Stemming** and **lemmatization**: both **simplify words (aka tokens) to their base form**, but they do it differently. 

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: stemmatization and lemmatization

**Stemming** means reducing a token to its **root stem** by chopping the last part of a token
* Examples: dogs become dog, walked becomes walk
* Faster, but not always accurate. Example: caring becomes car, changing becomes chang, better becomes bett

--

**Lemmatization** mean reducing a token to its **root lemma** by using their meaning; the token is converted to the concept that it represents
* Examples: dogs become dog, walked becomes walk, 
* Slower, but more accurate. Example: caring becomes care, changing becomes change, better becomes good

--

Why do we want to simplify words to prepare the data for analysis?

---

### 2. Data pre-processing: more tasks

More advanced pre-processing tasks, only applied to specific analyses:

* POS or Part-Of-Speech tagging (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) 
* NER or Named Entity Recognition tagging (person, place, company, etc.)
* etc.

---

### 3. Data transformation

In text mining, data transformation **means converting the text into numbers**: a quantifiable measure that a computer can process.

Usually this means transforming the raw textual data (the document) into a vector of countable units:

* Bag-of-words models: creates a document-term matrix (one row for each document, and one column for each term -- we see this next lecture for topic models!)
* Word embedding models: more advanced versions of bag-of-words models

---

### 4. Data analysis

* Basic exploratory techniques:
    * Word frequencies: using simple counts or using a method called TF-IDF
    * Relationship between words: using n-grams or using correlations
    
* Approaches based on simple NLP techniques:
  * Sentiment analysis (SM)
  * Topic modeling (TM)
  
* Approaches based on complex NLP techniques (advanced sentiment analysis with BERT or Vader methods; Machine translation; complex question answering; various neural networks for NLP)  

--

Today we talk about basic exploratory analyses (Chapter 1, 3, and 4 of the book Tex Mining with R), next lecture we do SM and TM (Chapter 2 and 6 of the same book)

---

### 4. Data analysis: word frequencies (Ch. 1 and Ch. 3)

**Word frequencies with counts** 
* To find the frequency of a word 
* `single word / total count of words`

**Word frequencies with TF-IDF**
* To measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents
* Importance is defined by being common but not too common:
  * decreasing the weight for very commonly used words
  * increasing the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection or corpus of documents

---

### 4. Data analysis: relationship between words (Ch. 4)

**Relationship between words with n-grams** 
* which words tend to follow others immediately: use n-grams of size 2, 3, 4, etc. to find set of consecutive words
* use `unnest_tokens()` Chapter 4.1

**Relationship between words with correlations**  
* which words tend to commonly appear together in a document, but do not necessarily occur next to each other: use the phi_coefficient to measure correlations among words: how often two words appear together / how often they appear separately
* use `pairwise_corr()` Chapter 4.2

## Specific workflow for text mining with tidy R
  
---

### Recap: general workflow in four steps

Wide range of methods, but similar workflow. We can think at it as a 4-step process:

1. Obtain your textual data

1. Data pre-processing 

1. Data transformation (from words to numbers)

1. Data analysis (wide range of methods; content of previous steps depends on the data analysis)


---

### Text mining workflow using R tidyverse

There are different ways to complete these steps in R, and different packages have their own approach. We learn how to perform these operations within the tidyverse. 

--

Figure 1.1 from the readings (Ch. 1): 
![](tmwr_0101.png)

--

Data pre-processing step: we start by converting text into a tidy format, which follows the same principles of tidy analysis we have learned so far; then apply the other techniques (removing stopwords, etc.)


---

### The tidy text format

A tidy text format is defined as **a table with one-token-per-row**:

* take your text
* put into a tibble
* convert into the tidy text format with `unnest_tokens()` function
* other pre-processing techniques are automatically applied (punctuation removed, and text converted to lower case)

See [`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) for more info

---

### The tidy text format: [unnest_tokens](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html#the-unnest_tokens-function)

```
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

text <- c("I bought three books online, but I forgot Bob Dylan's biography.",
          "I'll e-mail the seller to add it to my order!",
          "I love buying online, it is more convenient than going to the store.")

# convert into a data frame
text_df <- tibble(line = 1:3, text = text)
text_df

# convert into one-token-per-document-per-row
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

--

Why do we convert to tidytext? from a dataframe we can't do analyses (e.g., we can’t filter out words or count which occur most frequently, since each row is made up of multiple combined words)

---

### Text mining workflow using R tidyverse

Now that we have learned the `unnest_token` function in R, let's see how we can apply the general workflow for text analysis (obtain, pre-process, transform, analyze data) using the tidyverse. 

We do so with two examples (download them from in-class materials):
* Jane Austen example from the book
* Billboard example

---

### Example 1: Jane Austen texts

We use this example to show

* Get data: already in R

* Pre-process data: 
 * tokenize (one-row-per-line format with unnest_tokens)
 * conversion to lowercase and punctuation removal are automatically applied
 * remove stopwords

* Transform data: no specific transformation, use the one-row-per-line format 

* Analyze data: word frequencies with count (Ch 1), TF-IDF (Ch 3), relationship between words (Ch 4)

---

### Example 2: Billboard 

We use this example for further practice with real data. 

* Question to anwwer: How often is each U.S. state mentioned in a popular song? 
* We’ll define popular songs as those in Billboard’s Year-End Hot 100 from 1958 to the present. 
* Two source of data: Billboard Year-End Hot 100 (1958-present) and the Census Bureau ACS

<!--
NB: the tidy text format is specific to R tidyverse VS. document-term matrix, which is a general format for NLP and has one-document-per-row and one-term-per-column
