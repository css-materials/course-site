## Control structures: definition and types 

---

### Control structures: definition

All programs we have written so far can be seen as a finite and fixed sequence of commands.

**Control structures** allow us to vary our commands by **controlling their flow of execution**. How? by adding some “logic” into our R code, rather than executing the same code every time.

---

### Main control structures

* **Conditional statements**: test one or more condition(s) and act on it/them
* **`for` loop**: execute a loop for a fixed number of times
* **`while` loop**: execute a loop while a condition is true

> Review Chapter 13 “Control Structures” in *R programming for Data Science* and Chapter 21 “Iteration” in *R for Data Science* for details.

---

class: inverse, middle

## Conditional statements
 
 * single test with `if-else`
 * multiple tests with `if, else if, else`
 * nested conditionals
 * `ifelse()`
 * Practice exercises
   

---

### if-else 

if-else tests a condition and acts on it depending on whether the condition is TRUE or FALSE.

.small[
Syntax:
```
if (condition to be evaluated) {
    action performed when condition is TRUE
} 
else {
    action performed when condition is FALSE
}
```

Example:
```{r}
age <- 14
if (age > 16) {
  print("You are elegible to get a driving license")
} else {
  print("You cannot drive")
}
```
]

<!-- available options for size in descending order are:
Huge > huge > LARGE > Large > large > normalsize > small > footnotesize > scriptsize > tiny -->

---

### if-else 

Example: What is the output of this code?
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
my_numbers <- c(3,4,5,"6",7)

if (!is.numeric(my_numbers)) {
  print("At least one element is not numeric. Only provide numbers.")
} else {
  print("All numeric elements")
}
```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_numbers <- c(3,4,5,"6",7)

if(!is.numeric(my_numbers)) {
  print("At least one element is not numeric. Only provide numbers.")
} else {
  print("All numeric elements")
}
```


---

### if, else if, else

We can expand the basic if-else structure to incorporate **multiple tests** using **`else if`**


Syntax:
```
if (condition 1 to be evaluated) {
    action 1 performed when condition 1 is TRUE
} 
else if (condition 2 to be evaluated) {  
    action 2 performed when condition 2 is TRUE
}
else {
    action performed when condition 2 is FALSE
}
```

--

Conditional statements are evaluated **sequentially**: conditions are checked one-by-one in the order they are written. Once R finds a TRUE condition, it stops, and the remaining conditions are not evaluated.

---

### if, else if, else

Example: check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero
```{r}
x <- 0

if (x > 0) {
  print("x is a positive number")
} else if (x < 0) {
  print("x is a negative number")
} else {
  print("x is zero")
}
```

---

### Nested if-else

Use nested if-else statements to specify **conditions inside conditions**. What does this code do? (the `%%` operator gives the remainder from a division).

.small[
```{r}
x <- 15

if (x > 0) {
  if (x %% 2 == 0) {  
    print("x is a positive even number")
  } else {
    print("x is a positive odd number")
  }

} else {
  if (x %% 2 == 0) {
    print("x is a negative even number")
  } else {
    print("x is a negative odd number")
  }
}
```
]

<!-- modulo is the reminder after dividing one number by another. Here 15 : 2 = 7, 1 is the reminder, thus the number is odd -->

---

### ifelse()

R accepts `if` and `else` statements, but also statements using the built-in **`ifelse()`**  

.small[
Syntax:
```
ifelse (condition to be evaluated,
    action performed when condition is TRUE,
    action performed when condition is FALSE)
}
```

Example:
```{r}
y <- 3
ifelse(sqrt(16) > y, 
       sqrt(16),
       0)
```
] 
==
There is also a `dplyr` version of `ifelse()`, called `if_else()`: [documentation here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/if_else.html)

---

### ifelse()

Example: What is the output of this code?
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
numbers <- c(10, 6, 7)
ifelse(numbers %% 2 == 1, 
       "odd",
       "even")
```

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
numbers <- c(10, 6, 7)
ifelse(numbers %% 2 == 1,
       "odd",  
       "even")
```

--

Note the input here is a vector, not a single number, thus the output is also a vector: the code will evaluate each element of the vector. 

This is because **`ifelse()` supports vectorized operations**: operations directly applied on entire vectors of data, rather than looping through individual elements one-by-one.


<!--
How can we rewrite the same code using the standard `if-else` statement?

```
# won't work
numbers <- c(10, 6, 7)
if (numbers %% 2 == 1) { 
  print("odd")
} else {
  print("even")
}
```

```
# need a loop
numbers <- c(10, 6, 7)
for (i in 1:length(numbers)) {
  if (numbers[i] %% 2 == 1) {
    print("odd")
    } 
else 
  print("even")
 }
```
-->

---

### ifelse()

Example: What is the output of this code?
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
qualify <- data.frame("Athlet" = c("Noah", "Julio", "Nick", "Maria"), 
                      "Scores" = c(32, 37, 28, 30))

ifelse(qualify$"Scores" > 30, "Admitted", "Rejected")
```

--
Example: What is the output of this code?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
qualify <- data.frame("Athlet" = c("Noah", "Julio", "Nick", "Maria"), 
                      "Scores" = c(32, 37, 28, 30))

ifelse(qualify$"Scores" > 30, "Admitted", "Rejected")
```

## For loops
 
 * For loop definition and examples
 * Nested for loop
 * Same operation with and without a for loop
 * Practice exercises

---

### Definition of for loops

For loops are the most common looping construct to **iterate over the elements of an object** (list, vector, etc.) and apply some statement(s) to each of them.

Syntax:
```
for (item in sequence of items) {
  statement(s)    
}
```

Example:
```{r}
for (item in 1:3) {
  print(item)
}
```

---

### For loop example

```{r}
for (item in 1:3){
  print(item)
}
```

Let's unpack this example:
* the statement we are executing here is simple: we print `item` using the `print()` function
* `item` is a placeholder: at each iteration of the loop, the element `item` varies 
* the number of repetitions of the statement block depends on the number of items in the sequence of numbers we provide, in this example 3
* `item` can be labeled anything else, R does not care as long as you are consistent

---

### For loop example

```{r}
for (i in 1:3){
  print(i)
  print("Hello")
  sum <- i + 100
  print(sum)
}
```

<!-- What is this loop doing? Have someone describing it 
what happens if I add a print(i) at the end outside the loop: prints last i-->


---

### Nested for loops

- The **outer loop** controls the number of complete repetitions of the inner loop
- The **inner loop** is executed N-times for every execution of the outer loop

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
  for (j in c("a", "b")) {
    print(j)
  }
}
```

<!--
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
  for (j in c('a', 'b')) {
    print(i)
    print(paste(i, "outer"))
    print(j)
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
-->

---

### Same operation without and with a for loop on a data frame

Get the data:
```{r, results = "hide"}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
```

Perform some transformations and save the results in a new data frame:
```{r}
penguins_clean <- 
  select(penguins, 3:6) %>%
  drop_na()
head(penguins_clean, n = 3)
```

---

### Mean value per each column without a loop:

Procedure: take the mean function, and apply it to each column of the data frame (we can use the `$` sign to access columns within a data frame).

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
mean(penguins_clean$bill_length_mm)
mean(penguins_clean$bill_depth_mm)
mean(penguins_clean$flipper_length_mm)
mean(penguins_clean$body_mass_g)
```

This works but is a lot of copying/pasting...

---

### Mean value per each column with a loop:

Procedure: initialize an empty vector to store results, then apply a for loop.

```{r}
output <- vector(mode = "double", length = ncol(penguins_clean))

for (i in seq_along(penguins_clean)) {
  output[[i]] <- mean(penguins_clean[[i]])
}
output
```

--

For loops include three components: 
* output (to store results; pre-allocating the output with a given length makes the loop much faster)
* sequence (what goes in the for loop)
* body (the statements to be executed every time through the loop)

Let's unpack them: open the **demo .Rmd** in today's class materials to follow along!

---

### Benefits of preallocation

<!-- This explains why we are pre-allocating in the first place, and why we do so with a vector:
having an object that is already of the same length of the output, where we are just plugging in  individual values increases speed, rather the more naive approach in which we store reuslts using an  mpty vector or an empty other object (e.g. a dataframe) of length zero, and then append or add on each of the values as we calculate them

For example, let's take this mpg data (built in dataframe in R about auto, we do not really care about the content of the data); here what we are doing is creating duplicates of that dataframe 100 times and we are then putting them together into a single data frame. 

Without preallocation: we can create an empty dataframe (here with the tibble function), iterate over 100 times, take this empty dataframe and combine the rows of it with the rows of the original dataframe, and replace the original object with the new copy and save in output (so we are appending 100 rows every time we iterate!) 

If we do proper preallocation: we create a list of 100 empty elements, every time we store the results in the list, then we use the bind_rows() functions at the end

The first approach does not preallocate by creating an empty space to store the output, the second does. See the difference in time of execution. From 80 milliseconds to less than 3. So you can see how inefficient is not to allocate since most of our data will have more than 100 rows!

-->

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```r
# no preallocation
mpg_no_preall <- tibble()
for(i in 1:100){
  mpg_no_preall <- bind_rows(mpg_no_preall, mpg)
}

# with preallocation using a list
mpg_preall <- vector(mode = "list", length = 100)
for(i in 1:100){
  mpg_preall[[i]] <- mpg
}
mpg_preall <- bind_rows(mpg_preall)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r}
#| out.width = "70%",
#| echo = FALSE
# load microbenchmark library to time code
library(microbenchmark)
# bind together 100 copies of mpg
times <- microbenchmark(
  `No preallocation` = {
    mpg_no_preall <- tibble()
    
    for(i in 1:100){
      mpg_no_preall <- bind_rows(mpg_no_preall, mpg)
    }
  },
  `Preallocation` = {
    mpg_preall <- vector(mode = "list", length = 100)
    
    for(i in 1:100){
      mpg_preall[[i]] <- mpg
    }
    
    mpg_preall <- bind_rows(mpg_preall)
  }
)
autoplot(times)
```

## Alternatives to for loops in R 

  * Iteration with `map_*()` functions
  * Iteration with `across()`
  * Practice exercises

---

## Map functions

<!-- As we have seen in the slides and practice, we kind of have to write a lot of code for a for loop, for example to calculate a straightforward operation like the mean or median etc. so R gives us a shortcut: map functions which come from the purrr package in R and are much more compact (go to the documentation page)
-->

R provides alternatives to for loops: **`for` loops are good, but `map()` functions may be even better!** 

They come from the `purr` package in R https://purrr.tidyverse.org/

There are **different `map()` functions** depending on the type of output you want to create -- notice this is the same thing in the for loop when we specify the mode of our output vector:

- `map()` makes a list
- `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector
- `map_int()` makes an integer vector
- `map_dbl()` makes a double vector
- `map_chr()` makes a character vector

---

## Map functions

Let's see an example using the built-in [`mtcars` data frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars):

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

---

## Map functions

Pick the `map()` function you need and specify two main arguments (for more see documentation): 
* what you are iterating over
* what you are calculating

```{r}
map_dbl(mtcars, median)
map_dbl(mtcars, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

## Map functions

We can use `map()` functions also with the `%>%` operator:

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  map_dbl(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

## Across function

We’ve seen how to use loops and `map()` functions to solve the same task. **Let's review one final method: the `across()` function**.

Notice:
* `across()` comes from the `dplyr` package
* `map()` functions come from the `purr` package

Advantages:
* `across()` makes it easy to apply the same transformation to multiple columns in a data frame
* since it comes from `dplyr()`, it is well integrated with `dplyr` verbs!

---

### Single column

Using the `dplyr` verb `summarize()`, we can easily calculate the mean of one column without the help of `map()` or `across()`. Here we calculate the mean of `mpg` using the built-in `mtcars` data:
```{r cp-mean-single-column}
mtcars %>%
  summarize(miles_gallon = mean(mpg))
```

---

### Multiple columns

We can extend the same operation to multiple columns, as follows:
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  summarize(
    miles_gallon = mean(mpg),
    cylinders = mean(cyl),
    displacement = mean(disp),
    horsepower = mean(hp),
    rear_axle_ratio = mean(drat),
    weight = mean(wt)
  )
```
This works... but we can do this same operator more efficiently using `across()`

---

## `dplyr::across()`

`across()` has two main arguments:

* `.cols`: columns you want to operate on; can select columns by position, name, and type
* `.fns`: is a function or list of functions to apply to each column

We now review some examples of `across()` in conjunction with its favorite verb, `summarize()` 

Check the documentation for more examples and applications: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html

---

### `summarize()`, `across()`, and `everything()`

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Single function]
```{r summarize-across-everything}
# calculate the mean on all columns of mtcars, use everything() to select all variables
mtcars %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = everything(), 
                   .fns = mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Multiple functions]
```{r summarize-across-everything-fns}
# to apply multiple summaries, store the functions in a list
mtcars %>%
  summarize(across(everything(),
                   .fns = list(min, max)))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Multiple named functions]
```{r summarize-across-everything-fns-named}
# provide names to variables, to clearly distinguish each summarized variable
mtcars %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), 
                   .fns = list(min = min, max = max)))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Grouped by]
```{r summarize-across-everything-group-by}
# use with group_by() to calculate the mean of all columns for each group
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), 
                   .fns = mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```
]
]

<!-- https://willhipson.netlify.app/post/dplyr_across/dplyr_across/ -->

---

## More examples using the [`worldbank` data](https://data.worldbank.org/)

```{r worldbank}
data("worldbank", package = "rcis")
worldbank
```

---

### `summarize()`, `across()`, and `where()`

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Single condition]
```{r summarize-across-where}
# use across() with where() to pick variables based on type (e.g. is.numeric(), etc.)
worldbank %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = where(is.numeric), .fns = mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Compound condition]
```{r summarize-across-compound}
# or pick variables based on type and whose name begins with "perc"
worldbank %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(across(
    .cols = where(is.numeric) & starts_with("perc"),
    .fn = mean, na.rm = TRUE
  ))
```
]

]

---

### `across()` and `filter()`

To use `across()` with `filter()`, we need an extra step: `if_any()` or `if_all()`

```{r filter-if-any, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
# if_any() keeps rows where the predicate is true for at least one column
worldbank %>%
  filter(if_any(everything(), ~ !is.na(.x)))
```

```{r filter-if-all, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
# if_all() keeps rows where the predicate is true for all selected columns
worldbank %>%
  filter(if_all(everything(), ~ !is.na(.x)))
```

## While loops

  * Definition
  * Examples
  * Main use

---

## Definition of while loops

* A while loop begins by evaluating a condition 
* If the condition is TRUE, R executes the loop body
* Once the loop body is executed, R starts over: the condition is evaluated again, and so forth, until the condition is FALSE  
* At that point, R stops the while loop

---

### While loop example

Syntax:
```
while (condition to be evaluated) {
  statement(s)
}
```

Example:
```{r}
counter <- 1

while(counter <= 4) {
  print(counter)
  counter <- counter + 1
}
```

<!-- 
set the counter outside the loop, usually to 1
set a condition to be evaluated: here the condition says the counter has to be smaller or equal to 4
if the condition is TRUE, the loop is executed, here we only print(counter)
thus the first time it prints 1
but if we leave it as it is (without the last line of code), the while loops will keep going infinitely: we need a way to break the loop
thus we increment our counter inside the loop by redefining it as counter + 1
-->
---


### While loop example

Let's take the same example, but print `counter` also at the end. Why are the results different?

```{r}
counter <- 1

while(counter <= 3) {
  print(counter)
  counter <- counter + 1
  print(counter)
}
```

---

### While loop example

Let's take the same example, but do not increment our `counter` variable. What do you predict it will happen?

```
counter <- 1
while(counter < 3){
  print(counter)
}
```
--

Infinite loop!

---

### While loop example

What is the output of this code?
```{r}
counter <- 1
while(counter < 4){
  print(counter)

### While loops uses

While loops are best used **when you do not know how long the input sequence should run for**. For example, you might want to loop until you get three heads in a row in a random sequence of numbers. You can’t do that with a for loop.


While loops usually require a **"count variable"** to be set outside the loop.

While are **less common than for loops**, that's why we do not go in-depth.
